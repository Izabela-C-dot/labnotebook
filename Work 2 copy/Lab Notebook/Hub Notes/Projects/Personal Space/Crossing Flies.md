both mary and karin need crosses set up

mary - pip10 males and chr females
karin - ppk males and chr females

8-10 males and 8-10 virgin females in a bottle together, flip every **2-3 days**

crosses get combined labels - grab labels from mary's box

## ppk
once f1 flies start to emerge from the cross bottles 
1. gather virgin (f1) females **WITHOUT STUBBY** ie with long hairs on the back of the head 
2. put the flies on ATR for 2-7 days (age is the time they are on ATR) 
3. test flies 

## pip10
1. No **STUBBY** 
2. No **CURLY**

if i am unsure if the flies are virgins or not? gather and age at 25C to look for signs of procreation - include this aging time as part of the age in the meta data sheet

try and house sums of 5 together for easier testing

if im not sure if I have virgin females - put them on ATR and age them for 5 days
