Karin has a really cool project planned - protocol written - but is going to be out of state for the summer
SO for the next **2 weeks** while she's still here, I'm going to talk with here about what she's doing, why she's doing it, getting familiar with the drive and the protocol to carry out data collection while she's gone

- Get trained on working with flies by someone (hibah/mary/karin/lydia)
	- sexing + using the trays + pushing
- Get familiar with the protocol
	- what experiments does karin have planned
	- what is the protocol for these experiments
	- why are we running these experiments, whats the drive
- dry runs using the software
	- how to record video
	- how to start and stop recordings
	- where to upload videos

## What training do I need?

- Using the software
- Using the microscope and optogenetic system
- Recording video
- Saving video
- Sexing flies
- Pushing flies
- Flipping flies
- Protocol details
- Purpose details
