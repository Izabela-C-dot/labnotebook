'All Trans Retinal' - Karin's optogenetic flies need to eat special food to develop photosensitive pathways in their cells

*we had to pause this, as Karin and sama need to make more ATR stock solution*

The food is light sensitive, and needs to stay dark

1 bottle = ~ 50 ml = ~ 10 vials of fly food

Making ATR food is a lab coat job, as the ATR is a carcinogen *need to order a lab coat in my size*

make sure the food is liquid enough to settle flat, but not to hot as to destroy the ATR - below 60C

1mL of ATR solution for every 100mL food
- track the number of bottles you use per ATR batch, 1 bottle is ~50mL of food, use at least 2 (more reasonable to use 4) when making batches of ATR food

1. Gather X bottles you need from the cold room and bring them to 332 
	- 1 bottle = 10 vials
2. Gather 10X vial covers from the shelf in 342. These are either 3D printed tubes, or tinfoil sleeves. Grab a vial tray from 342. Bring these to 332
3. Place plastic tubes from the box in 332 into the sleeves and then place them in the vial rack
4. Put on a lab coat
5. Rinse the glass beaker and the metal spatula with water
6. Scrape food from the bottles into the beaker using the spatula
7. Microwave the food in 10-20 second increments, stirring as you heat it to be fully liquid (needs to be melted enough to be pippetted)
8. Once the food is the right consistency, allow it to cool to hot tub temperature before adding the ATR stock solution (ATR is heat and light sensitive)
9. Using the serological pipette, move the desired amount of food into a beaker (this allows the ratio of ATR solution to food to be more exact)
10. Add the required amount of ATR solution to this small beaker of food, and mix it using the spatula
11. Ensure that all test tubes are inside of sleeves before pipetting food into them, to protect the ATR food from the light
12. Using the serological pipette, add 5-8 mL of food to each sleeved tube
13. Cover the test tubes with cheesecloth and allow them to fully cool
14. Once the tubes are fully cooled, use kimwipes to remove condensation from the inside of the tubes, and then plug them
15. Place plugged, sleeved and date labeled ATR food tubes the shared lab fridge
