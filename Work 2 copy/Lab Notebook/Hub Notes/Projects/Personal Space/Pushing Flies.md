The software to open is 'Leica Application'

Upper switch on the right side of the microscope to turn it on, light controlled on the arm

1) twist the metal knob to open CO2 flow, twist plastic knob to the right to modulate the flow
2) test the fly gun for a good solid airstream, feel it on your hand
3) tilt the bottle/vial on its side, open it a small amount and put the tip of the gun in
	- the bottle stays on its side as you push the flies, to make sure any leftover flies don't fall into the food
4) gas for ~ 1 minute *double check that* and then tap the flies onto the fly pad
	- only put as many flies on the pas as you can count in ~10 minutes, err on less
5) put the flies in a straight line on the fly pad for easy sorting
6) flick flies one direction for female and the other direction for male. go quickly
7) collect female flies and age them in the incubator for a few days (2-3) to make sure you only have female virgins
8) toss males into the morgue
9) wipe the fly pad with ethanol when done

Karin's project only uses female flies, so for other projects I won't always be tossing the males

this fly line has a stubby balancer - if the flies have short hairs *double check what this looks like* they don't have UAS - Chrimson and can be tossed

female flies eclose sooner, stubby eclose later, so depending on when you check the vials there may only be non stubby female flies

*i have a note that says 'incubator ~10 days for new flies to come up' - need to double check what that means*

Female flies
- fleshy genitalia

Male flies
- harder darker genitalia
- dark abdomen
- sex combs
