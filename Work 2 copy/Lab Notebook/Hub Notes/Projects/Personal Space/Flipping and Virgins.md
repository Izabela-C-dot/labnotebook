# flipping flies
1) take the cap off the new bottle
2) tap the old bottle down
3) get the new bottle in position near the top of the old bottle
4) remove the plug from the old bottle and put the new one in place quickly
5) flip the old on top to bounce all the flies down
	- be careful, if the food is too liquidy it could drip or drop

after flipping, make sure all adults are out of the bottle, or pushed into the food with a wooden stick

Flip UAS Chr / other stock G1 flies every **3-4 days** (to gather virgins to make the testing generation)
Flip crossed flies every **2-3 days** (to gather virgins to test)

oldest bottles in the back of the tray

you are essentially moving the same group of flies through different bottles to get them to breed and lay eggs, so you can come back in a few days and collect virgins out of the bottle that you flipped flies out of
# collecting virgins
you collect virgins EVERY DAY when they start to eclose

you collect from the oldest bottle first, and once they run out of eclosing adults you should be able to move to the newer bottles

use the clock method - flies can't procreate for several hours after eclosing, so if you collect them at 10:30 and at 4:30, you can be reasonably certain that you'll have virgin flies 
- 18C - takes about 18 hours to be able to procreate
- 25C - takes about 8 hours to be able to procreate

keep the flies in 18C overnight and over the weekend
keep the flies in 25C between 1030 and 430 

if you aren't sure if a fly is a virgin or not, add a '?' to the bottle and age them for 5 days (in 25C) - they should begin laying eggs / seeing evidence of them not being a virgin in that time
