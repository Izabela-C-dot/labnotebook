Operating the microscope + computer in 365

1) fill an insulated ice bucket from 342 with ice from the 4th floor
2) Password to the computer in 365 is '2023'
3) check the metadata sheet and fill it out with the appropriate information
	- time - the time of the test, in military time
	- age - age of the flies, between 2 and 7 days, the number of days post collection + ATR introduction 

AnalogSQRWVppk is the correct program to run on bonsai

note coffee intake - brush teeth and swish mouth if you had some that day (caffeine can affect the flies)

video naming - pc#_ YYMMDDgeno#femaleflies
**important** - include your initials at the end of the video + csv name to communicate who the assay was completed by - important for future proofing the results of the test
*copy an example name here, with it translated*

BEFORE running video
1) click the video writer
2) add '.mp4' to the end of the name (or the video won't play)
3) set overwrite to 'false'
Name the CSV file the same thing as the video file
1) click the csv writer
2) add '.csv' to the end of the file name
3) set overwrite to 'false'

**Running Assays**
1) select the current bonsai protocol - "[name]"
2) make necessary changes to video name / csv name - pc#_ YYMMDDgeno#femaleflies
3) submerge the tube of flies on its *side* in the ice bucket for ~2.5 minutes
4) tap the flies into a petri dish settled on the ice to count them
5) use the fly putter to move flies in multiples of 5 from the petri dish to the behavior arena
	- If there is not a multiple of 5 within a vial, vials can be combined, so long as the flies were collected on the same day
6) flies take ~5 minutes to wake up once off the ice, set a timer for 5 minutes
7) while waiting the 5 minutes, fill out information in the meta data sheet
8) turn off the room lights - ambient lights can affect fly behavior
9) turn on IR lights (ie the power strip) below the table
10) Open python and check the flies in the camera *double check how to do this*
11) press start on the bonsai program, let run for 30 minutes
12) Once the program has concluded, save the video and csv file to 'Karin' - 'Data'
13) Additionally, save the video and CSV files to the AhmedLab server (\\\\ 172.25.226.40) under 'dat' 'proxemics' 'pc-ppkchr-f'
14) suck up flies from the behavior arena with the fly putter
15) spit the flies into the trap
16) toss the old vial
17) if completed with testing for the day, dump ice in the combined lab space sink

- if a fly lands outside of the testing arena, do not use it in tests
- after using the fly putter to get them out of the petri dish, you can use a paintbrush for some more detail oriented gentle movements
- flies go on their SIDE when in the ice, so they don't get stuck in the food

- **Important** you need to hit CTRL + S to save settings in bonsai

### 8.26.2024 updates
**Running Assays**
1) select the current bonsai protocol - "[name]"
2) make necessary changes to video name / csv name - pc#_ YYMMDDgeno#femaleflies
3) fill a petri dish lid with ice and settle a petri dish base into the ice. place a dry petri dish lid on top of the petri dish whenever the petri dish is not in use
4) submerge the tube of flies on its side in the ice bucket for ~3 minutes
5) tap the flies into a petri dish settled on the ice to count them
6) use the fly putter to move flies in multiples of 5 from the petri dish to the behavior arena
	- If there is not a multiple of 5 within a vial, vials can be combined, so long as the flies were collected on the same day
8) fill out information for the test in the meta data sheet
9) turn off the room lights - ambient lights can affect fly behavior
10) turn on IR lights (ie the power strip) below the table
12) press start on the bonsai program,  and set a timer for 35 minutes 
13) Once the 35 minutes have passed, save the video and csv file to 'Karin' - 'Data'. Move the .mp4 and the .csv file into 'karin-data'
14) copy the video and CSV files to the AhmedLab server (\ 172.25.226.40) under 'dat' -> 'proxemics' -> 'pc-ppkchr-f'
16) suck up the flies from the behavior arena with the fly putter and spit them into the fly morgue
18) toss the old vial
19) if completed with testing for the day, dump ice in the sink in 332
