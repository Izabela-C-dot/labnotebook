[[Crossing Flies]]

There are 3 conditions in the experiment : 
1) ppk - chr with ATR
2) ppk - chr without ATR
3) w1118 - chr with ATR

Assays with n values of 5-10-15 flies will be completed, with 15-20 tests of each n condition for each genomic condition

Test each n condition at a single time (ie complete all n = 5, then complete n = 10 and so on)
