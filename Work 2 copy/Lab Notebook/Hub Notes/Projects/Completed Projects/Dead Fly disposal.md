Autoclave or freeze, current plan is to autoclave

Autoclave is in 418 (clean room)

Need 
- autoclave bags (*do they need to be biohazard bags?*)
	- [[2024-05-15-Wed]] found autoclave biohazard bags in 332
- autoclave compatible plugs
- autoclave compatible bottles + vials

Research done on [[2024-05-09-Thu]], copied below
### autoclave research

Flugs
- Flystuff (cat # 49-100) Bonded Dense Weave Cellulose Acetate
	- given that there is another product that appears to be made of a different material (or at least is a different structure of the same material) and it is labeled as 'autoclaveable' and the flugs we use are not, i am going to assume they are not
	- called genesee - not autoclaveable
Vials
- Flystuff (cat # 32-116SB) polystyrene
	- called genesee - not autoclaveable

Alternatives to autoclaving (ie no/reduced material change)
- freezing the flies (*could we do this in a chest freezer set up in the cold room or use another labs space? - would probably be best to not have to transport the materials / rely on the space of others - how cold does the freezer need to be?)

Alternatives that ARE autoclaveable

Plugs
- Droso-Plugs 
	- Vial size (cat # 59 - 200) genesee - $443.90 for 6760 (7 cents per plug) vs $176.65 for 1000 (18 cents per plug) (current) 
	- Bottle size (cat # 59-194P) genesee - $577.75 for 2560 (22 cents per plug) vs $234.05 for 1000 (23 cents per plug) (current)

Vials
- Glass Drosophila vials (cat # 32-201 / 32-201C) genesee - same size as the current polystyrene vials, but more expensive 
	- $618.34 for 720 vs $153.35 for 1000 (current)
- Polypropylene vials (cat # 32-120) genesee - same size as the current vials AND fully autoclaveable (according to genesee flystuff catalog) (autoclave settings - 121 C 15 psi 15 minutes) 
	- $73.95 for 500 (ie $148 for 1000) compared to $153 for 1000 (current)

Bottles
- polypropylene bottles (cat # 32-129F) genesee - 8 oz round bottom
	- $124.98 for 250
- polypropylene bottles (cat # 32-130) genesee - 6 oz square bottom
	- $155.50 for 500

autoclaveable = reusable, so would we want to reuse these (ie autoclave, then empty, then toss and reuse). or would that be too much work?

---
Tuthill lab freezes their flies, which we could do without changing the materials we use BUT we would either need to find freezer space we can use (and then determine if we are allowed to move flies to that space) OR get a freezer ourselves (how cold do the flies need to be? would a regular chest freezer work for this?)

---
unclear if dead flies need to be thrown away in biohazard bags, something to ask hibah / other fly labs about

---
stephanie says they throw away bees, but freeze (+ autoclave sal said) octopus
tuthill lab just freeze their flies, parrish lab maybe autoclaves?
- ask the parrish lab (5.10 checked in person, found no one, hibah reaching out) what they do for the autoclave
--- 
- measure the cold room (342A?) AND THE DOORWAYS (remember the double doorways that have to be worked around) for a freezer - don't want to get one too small to be useful OR too large to fit
	- ALSO write and post rules for the cold room (no plastic on floor, no cardboard on floor etc) to help with compliance (stay away from mites / mold)

related to [[Dead Fly disposal]] project
sama has emailed some people and got very by the book answers on what they do with their flies, which may not be what they actually do with the flies

- reach out to EH&S and ask what other fly labs do to dispose of their flies
	- *ask this when I have a couple more questions, like what kind + how many fire extinguishers we need*

Sal gave me some autoclave biohazard bags and I've begun to autoclave and toss the fly bags!
Autoclave instructions - 
1) place waste inside of an autoclave bag
2) loosely tape the autoclave bag closed with autoclave tape
3) use the foot pedal on the bottom of the autoclave to open it
4) place the bag on top of the tray with no holes *not sure if tie direction matters, will test today*
5) place a test indicator strip on the rack, NOT the tray
6) close the autoclave with the foot pedal
7) select 'waste'
8) let the cycle run for ~ 2 hours
10) inspect the orange gloves for holes
11) tape the paper indicator into the load log, if the blue isn't all the way through, add a new paper indicator and run the cycle again
12) use the orange gloves to move the bag and tray to the sink, drain the liquid from the tray into the sink, leave the bag in the sink for ~ 1 hour to cool
13) once the waste is cool, toss it into the dumpster behind the architecture building
