## needs for the computer
- prioritize data storage + ram
- windows / linux instead of mac

- **look at kyle workstation on agora**
	- change motherboard to an ATX instead of ITX
		- for more slots for ram
		- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CASE
- nvidia gpu (to run bonsai)

Following up on convo w/ @Carter A â€” i agree, itâ€™s a good idea to get a 2nd computer for Maui

since itâ€™s just for data acquisition I think you wanna prioritize tons of data storage and decent RAM. Donâ€™t think we need a GPU for this station. Better to get Windows or Linux instead of mac.

@Kyle T has his workstation parts on the agora if you wanna springboard from there

The only rec I would suggest changing about my workstation and the beh acquisition is to go with a larger form factor â€” so changing the motherboard to an ATX instead of ITX to have more slots for RAM which would then mean a slightly different case. And possibly the cpu I got might be overkill if this computer will just be running a couple scripts and recording vids. Happy to help out with this or be a second set of eyes on the build configuration!

ah, Mary said bonsai requires a GPU and I do think we want to do closed-loop perturbations on maui in the future. So add a Nividia GPU ðŸ™‚
