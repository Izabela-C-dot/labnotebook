**compressed gas SOP**
- is carbogen a particularly hazardous substance?
- do i need to log gasses in mychem?
- where is the SDS for this gas 
	- I have not been able to find it on the linde site, nothing with 95% oxygen
		- *contacted linde to get an SDS*
- do we need IACUC approval for our use of carbogen?
- CAS - only found CAS for oxygen and carbon dioxide but not for the mix

- i am struggling with this - added that I am struggling to my slides to talk to sama with tomorrow
**come back to this late - something else now**

**laser registration**
- pulse rate (Hz) = pulse width 100 fs (at 900 nm) 
	- is 100 fs the rate?
- Serial number?
	- L-0000132 is what was autoflilled - but double check

TODAY

OKAY
- ive added comp gas questions to my slides to go over with sama - these will give me the basic shape of what needs to be filled out on the SOP
- ive contacted eh&s for information (they say i need lindes SDS + that there are no model SOPs)
- ive contacted linde for the SDS (left message)
- ive contacted OAW for rules with working with drosophila - none on website and with a search some other lab has said that fruit fly experiments don't count as animal experiments (left message)

Does our gas regulator contain a backflow preventative device?
- it does! it has a check valve so we're good there

print out and include the carbogen SDS
