1-1 with sama, quick notes for Maui todo 

for maui
- build enclosure for the laser beam before it enters the microscope apparatus
- build better enclosure for the microscope
- build stage for the microscope
	- attached to the board, able to lift and lower, running saline to the fly, running carbogen to oxygenate the saline, running CO2/air to lift the ball for the fly to stand on
- moving old compressed air bottles out
- labeling lab setup
- sama has contact people i can talk to, but i will be engineering and building the set up, which is cool

most expensive pieces - the objective and the two amplifiers on the wide of the scope

FOUND kyle left notes on building the laser enclosure in 359 and the supplies he purchased to build that enclosure - useful to contact him + read those notes when i begin work on that part

going through agora, notes on maui
- need to pick an expiration date for saline
- need to ensure that we have all the glassware + boats + spatulas needed for making saline
- need to make sure we have access to something that can measure osmolarity
- need to figure out if a filtering step needs to be added
- need to figure out how to dispose of the solution

is there a saline recipe they landed on using, or do we need to test some different ones out?

when working with the lab previously, princess was working on the stage for the fly holder, so i imagine she will have some insight on that

a lot of maui resources - including videos on how to operate the scope and perform dissections, are on the ahmedlab server

copied from twist - HUB - maui working group
Open projects:
- shield the laser path
- build the saline flowthrough system
- write agora for dissections (see Brezovec/Pacheco on psych server)
- write agora for measuring the point spread function *agora for this exists*
- write agora for measuring xyz resolution
- write agora for measuring laser power
- collect preliminary data for altan to start building analysis pipeline
- [+build the enclosure around the microscope](https://twist.com/a/188793/ch/693439/t/5625102/) *finished by kyle and princess, but needs to be updated*
END QUOTE (i added the italics above)

do we need to change or refill the coolant on the laser? it says it needed to be done in 11/2023, so check in on this with sama

follow through on enclosure notes to fix the roof of the microscope enclosure

[maui protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkKdBAYHqoqVd2qYFEyLX5BDIiBR3shsoVXriWocf7M/edit#heading=h.men3w2nn2dgx) written by kyle, still a wip but will be good to read through
- scanned through it, not confident i could follow it to operate with no other information. would be good to add to this, flesh it out and make it more followable (name the parts, add images of what things should or shouldnt look like/where different things are in the software/on the microscope)
