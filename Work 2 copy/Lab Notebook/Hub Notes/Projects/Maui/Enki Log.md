emailed akira with questions - want to visit tuthill again with specific focus on connection of vacuum to system and needles to sample platform

post maui meeting - we want the first version as quickly as possible 
order things and try to build that first version so its functional
flow controllers on the in and the out

see tuthill again, but the priority is on putting together an ordering list and putting together something FUNCTIONAL so data can be grabbed, and then improving it

Visited the tuthill lab with princess to see their saline flow system + then talked with princess about building our system

need to make sure the needles and the set up is out of the way of cameras and the rig

need to make sure the needles are out of the way of the objective

tuthill lab uses bent needles (so \_ kind of) and i think we should as well

i think if possible it would be nice to have the needles on their own micromanipulator (control) but having them on the same one as the sample could work (save space, not need to readjust BUT would have to consider needle placement relative to microscope)
