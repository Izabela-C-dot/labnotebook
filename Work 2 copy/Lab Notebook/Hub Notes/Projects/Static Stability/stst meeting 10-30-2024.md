brought up testing schedule to lydia 
- i will be testing in the morning - 9-1 
- goal is 4 tests a day minimum - try for as many as possible
- lydia will test in the afternoon 
	- we shouldn't overlap in our schedule, so we shouldn't have to use the scheduling sheet

## protocol
1) open the pylon viewer
	1) click the USB Basler camera to view the flies
2) flip vial 1 upside down, suck up Fly 1
3) keep your finger over the hole on the fly blower and occasionally inhale to keep the fly pulled in to the blower
4) flip vial 2 upside down, suck up Fly 2
5) open the fly arena up a little bit, and aspirate both flies into the arena
6) check the pylon viewer to look for damage on the flies wings or legs
	1) if damage is seen, suck up the flies and aspirate into the morgue. repeat steps 2-6 until you get 2 undamaged flies
7) CLOSE the pylon viewer
	1) the camera can only be accessed by one software at a time - so the pylon viewer has to be closed for bonsai to be able to access the camera
8) rename the bonsai video
	1) no '.' between 2 and 1 for kir2.1 (messes with the software)
9) start the bonsai video ASAP to avoid missing courtship
10) add the trial to the metadata sheet

## quality checking
- mark yes/no for copulation and the time stamp for copulation
- mark any leg/wing damage

- videos saved in the psych server under "24 iav kir2.1"

## genotypes
- the proprioceptors on the legs and wings are inhibited for the experimental genotype
	- how can the flies court with no proprioception?
	- does some kind of courting protocol take over in the flies brain that helps them court without the proprioception neurons 
	*clarify this with lydia, i want a firm grasp on this*

details from 11/4/2024 lab meeting

how does goal oriented behavior and context affect locomotion?
investigating the role of mechnosensory feedback in courtship behaviors
