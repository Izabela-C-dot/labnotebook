## lydia's project
- im going to meet with lydia today to assist on her project, which needs to be complete by december 1st
	- taking priority over meeting with mary for hotcell things

### project specs
- 3 male genotypes with 1 female genotype - testing courtship
	- kir2.1 x w1118 males - parental control
	- WT x iav males - parental control
	- kir2.1 x iav males - experimental genotype
	- cantonS females
- shooting for 25-30 assays of each genotype
	- lydia says she has about 23/24 done already

- 1 female and 1 male at a time in the arena
- BEFORE adding the flies inspect them for wing and leg damage - toss flies with any wing or leg damage
- make sure you remove the timer from the test - just start the test once the flies are loaded, no delay

- the goal is to test 4 a day, with a stretch goal of 6 a day
- lydia will put flies in the 1 pm incubator for me to test
	- age limit for flies is 14 days, the goal age is 3 - 10 days
