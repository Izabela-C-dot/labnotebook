## post coffee 1-1 notes
- if i need to address things with a lab member
	- reflect on values + address by grounding it in the values
	- i can always talk to sama and ask him to talk to the specific lab member without getting me directly involved
	- i can talk up in lab meetings and ground things in chancellorships
		- this is my chancellorship - how can people support me and make this easier for me?
		- this is someone elses chancellorship - how can we support them?
		- it is all our job to help + support
	- IF i have people supporting me in daily work (trash and fly traps etc) - it'll be easier for me to routineify the processes 
		- ie - if i only have to worry about autoclaving the bag and not monitoring the levels in the trash and replacing the bag and checking that the bottles are completely closed and taped itll be easier for me

- sama thinks a good skill for me would be FLY GENETICS
	- people should be able to come up to me and say 'i want to make this kind of fly, how do i do that?' and i should be able to help them
	- THINGS I SHOULD KNOW
		- balancers
		- reporter system
		- recombination
- a very helpful skill set, very puzzle focused
- PRACTICE SOME CROSSES! cross puzzles :3

- A thing that would be helpful to me 
	- getting clarity on priorities - ask sama 'Is this pressing?' 'Do I need to get this done now?' 'what is the timing needed for this?'
	- i may need to prod him for this - but i can go to him with this question and get support
