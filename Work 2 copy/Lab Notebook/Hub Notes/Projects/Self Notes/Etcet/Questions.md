Hours?
- Hours are flexible (10-6/9-5) so long as I get 8 in

ASK LATER THIS WEEK
- Could I miss some time on one day (ie do 10 to 5) and make up for it the next day / another day? (9 to 6)
*I think this lab is more relaxed than I'm used to most jobs being*

### How do I sync my personal Obsidian and the lab's? Or do I keep my record here and make it public / available to the lab once I leave?
- it'll get saved to the dropbox once I get that set up (partial answer, from 'how to keep a digital lab notebook)

### Do I need to be at work 9-5:30 to incorporate the 30 minute lunch break so workday doesn't freak out, or do I work 9-5 and report 9-5:30? 
*ask Hibah (she's in the same position as me), then sama if still confused*

### Should I wait until Hibah leaves and I get her computer to download more of the lab's required software, or should I download it onto my personal computer?
