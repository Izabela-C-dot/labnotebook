Tu Tong ([[People]])- in charge of all the money, on the first floor. Easier to drop in a talk (if he writes something he has to give the approved answer and he has to commit to what he writes, talking in person lets him be more flexible and creative and answer faster)

[[Twist]] and [[Obsidian]] are the programs for the lab

I have 333A as my office for the next two weeks until Hibah is gone (May 17th last day) and then I take over her office. Right now I'm writing on my personal computer, but once Hibah leaves, I'll be given the lab computer she has been using.
I'm going to shadow Hibah tomorrow, to ask questions

Keep a lab notebook - if analog copy it into Obsidian to create a record that can be referred to once I'm gone. Once Hibah is gone, I'll be able to look through her notebook for answers

Twist and the Agora 
If I improve on a process or have any notes that could help someone down the line, add it to Twist

Get settled as a tech, and then move onto a project.

FIRST TASK - Twist walkthrough and onboarding
- twist mark done with 'e'
- check threads marked done with 'g' then 'e'

My goals for today
- look through and familiarize myself with twist
- look through and familiarize myself with the agora
- prep a page of questions for hibah - maybe in my analog notebook, and then move it to my obsidian after for reference

Notes
- MASKS IN BAG (not required, but good to have if someone would prefer you mask)
- Timesheets AND leave requests due 1st and 16th of every month by 9 pm (leave must be sent and APPROVED by that time to kick in)
- Keep my time in workday (required 30 minute break )
- Lab notebook best practices - plain language, what i did and WHY i did it, backlinking extensively with obsidian
- I'm enjoying obsidian, and I'm excited to use it. Maybe I'll use it for more than just the lab, it seems like it would be really good for writing + DND 

I think i'm going to like obsidian. the interconnected nature appeals to me.

i think i'm really going to like it here :) i really want to
