## 365
- fly trash is completely overfull.
- flies are everywhere
- the fly trap was incredibly wet and soupy
- flies left in the chamber over night
- labels scattered around the lab space
- balled up labcoats on a table?
- i asked k to clear old samples off the table. she said she would. she didnt, so i set up the testing room (ie cleaned up after her) when in fact i have NO samples to test in the early period today

flies are EVERYWHERE which makes the small space really hard to work in.

it feels like a waste of my time to have to go in and clean up the space after not using it for a month 

I need to talk to the lab about 1) general cleanliness in lab environments and 2) finishing tasks - putting things where they belong + handling trash, all of the background tasks that are integral to running the research tasks.

i should not be the one cleaning 365 if i havent used it in a month.

*turn this into a document i can give to sama*

mary also left flies in prometheus after testing
