### Update lab safety manual
- [Ahmed Lab Safety Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--fzenomN_snYV8s8VslfqQmVVHBmsqR9Zh39Wx7XOY/edit)
- use EH&S guides (?) to update the manual

### Troubleshoot communication with the fly kitchen
- maybe help them make a list serv?
- problems where scheduling changes / interruptions are not communicated leading to issues getting enough food in time
	- tuthill lab (HSB - 320) usually has some extra if needed, but we have to replenish anything we take from them

### Troubleshoot fly food molding
- has something to do with vials / bottles being opened more often?
	- hibah has seen more mold in vials than bottles while in use (vials get opened and exposed to air / moisture more often)
- something to do with humidity?
	- on going humidity troubleshooting / experimenting with incubators and cold room
		- Hibah got a pump for the cold room, but it may not be the BEST pump, something to look into 
- [[2024-05-09-Thu]] - cold room mold focus sheet in UW EH&S LMS - suggest removing cardboard and lowering humidity, try this
- [[2024-05-23-Thu]] - started little informal mold test
### In depth SDS knowledge 
- near memorization would be the goal
- related - getting back into my chemistry vocabulary / understanding groove

### better biology / organic chemistry / neuropsychology knowledge
- does what it says on the tin, get proficient at my new area of research

### Lab Safety Binder Revamp
Lab safety binder needs to include
- UW Lab PPE Hazard Assessment
- EH&S Lab training matrices for everyone in the lab
	- filled out / completed / signed by sama
- Get access to mychem (SDS in lab?)

### Lab Safety Revamp
- respond to the EH&S safety inspection results, make a checklist and knock it off
- get mychem access

### Scheduling
- make schedules for lab functions (when to order food, when to flip, when to pick up food, when to autoclave) and share it to all lab members (if does not already exist)

### Makerspace trainings 
- laser cutter / 3d printer / etc - could be helpful in the lab if this needs to be done (essentially making myself an asset that can perform those tasks)

### Maui building
- engineering the sample platform w/ connections for saline and air 
- building a laser enclosure for the beam
- building a new enclosure for the microscope
- possibly dissecting flies and gathering data myself
more details in [[Work/Lab Notebook/Hub Notes/Projects/Maui|Maui]]

### general updates
- update the safety training sheet with required trainings for different positions
- update the consumables sheet with actual consumables + schedule for purchasing (karin is in charge of this, don't do this until you point it out to her) / get rid of it and use the purchasing sheet

### Consumable systems
- I want to develop a system for tracking the status of consumables in the lab
- im thinking a list of all consumables + location so that one day a week I can go through the lab spaces and check the consumables (maybe mondays so i can do ordering on tuesdays)
	- i can use the consumable sheet to make a list of the consumables w/ all required purchase information to make it easy to refill with the same thing 
	- I can make a checklist that i can print / keep track of digitally and walk around with and to create a paper trail that something was low / checked / etc
	- I can turn this into a weekly task that i dont have to think too hard about
		- I need a list of consumables
			- purchase and order sheet
			- ask lab members (make a list and share it with them to see if im missing anything)
		- I need purchase information for the consumables
			- from the purchase and order sheet, i can reformat for the weekly order sheet so i could just copy and paste when and where i need them
		- I need locations for these consumables 
			- purchase and order sheet 
			- ask lab members
		- I need to know what counts as 'low' for some of the consumables
			- How quickly do these things get used, what does Low look like?

### unpack and organize
unpack all the things in the lab!! i dont like it when things are still in boxes / packaging 
it adds to clutter in a way i hate
goes along with wanting to organize the lab in general

go thorugh the drawers and clean them out

### new fly traps 
without using food bottles, feels wasteful especially with how often we could have to make new traps - follow this link [here](https://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/fruitflytrap.shtml) for a trap with yeast and sugar and no fly food AND it will actually keep the flies from leaving the bottle - use a paper funnel and yeast + water, no sugar?

### labels
premake genotype labels, and store them inside of a page protector (cut down one side) and put in a binder / folder - like a reusable sticker sheet, but they don't have to just hang out on the box

### leica application
learn the leica microscope application better, to troubleshoot and solve issues, to operate correctly

### lab etiquette / standards for the rocketeers

### safety posters

## Safety Project 
- ~~Make a list of things to purchase for the lab
	- ~~spill kit - would it be better to buy materials to assemble my own, or to buy a premade one?
- Go thorugh notes and make lists
	- documents that need to be included in the lab binders
	- ~~objects that need to be present in the lab 
- Write down my thoughts and make a plan of attack 
	- cut things into small chunks, and start SOMEWHERE

- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30

## Consumables Project
- look over the sheet again and reorganize
	- format the sheet so individual rows can be copied and pasted into the weekly purchases sheet
- clarify the consumables on the list - brands, sizes, specifications that are important
	- i want like the actual actual items (instead of 'gloves' - > 'small nitrile gloves')
- recheck the consumables list and add things
- add secondary vendor for consumables 
- introduce list to lab members  
	- ask them to read over it and add things

- first baseline consumables check
	- based on this first check, add locations of consumables and reorganize sheet to be based on location

# etc little things
- replace the battery in the clock for 342
- get a food fridge to put in the cold room
- find out where to put the new tabletop in the pallet
