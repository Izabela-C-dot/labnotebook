## lab safety dashboard
- hibah needs to be removed
- need to update CHO
	- Yuqing Zhang -> Izabela Carpenter
## looking at EH&S report
- make a list here addressing the points in red (some have already been fixed / are on their way to being fixed) and some are not worth addressing (lab coat laundering, closing the fly trap etc)
	- the safety bench mark is only 85%, so we can ignore some of the points that don't apply to us and still make it
