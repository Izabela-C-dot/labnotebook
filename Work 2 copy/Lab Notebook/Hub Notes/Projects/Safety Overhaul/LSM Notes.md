Lab Spaces / Lab Manual / Lab Binder safety overhaul training

CURRENTLY: reading the UW EH&S LSM and taking notes on safety procedures / protocols that could apply to our lab

NEXT: once complete with the read, condense the notes into an actionable checklist (to improve the lab space / lab safety binders / digital lab manual) and implement the changes

Notes from LSM taken on [[2024-05-09-Thu]] copied below
Safety updates 
- complete SOPs (compressed gas and chemicals and laser *needed in 359 book only* and flies? and safety procedures) and add to 1) physical lab binder 2) digital lab book
Safety updates 
- complete SOPs (compressed gas and chemicals and laser *needed in 359 book only* and flies? and safety procedures) and add to 1) physical lab binder 2) digital lab book
#### Required in the lab
- ~~spill kits (need one for 342, 365, 332?)
- ~~lab signage (359 / 365)
	- described in sections 2.a.6 and 4.a of eh&s LSM
	- caution sign for 359 needs to contain laser danger information
	- ~~*usually mychem auto makes these signs, but they havent made the correct ones for 359 / 365 yet, posted in twist about it*
- ~~fire extinguisher in each room? (342 and 359 for sure likely, but 365?)
- ~~first aid kits in each room (332/342/359/365?)

#### Required in the binder
**All binders must include the following**
- CHP *note, the lab specific plan on pg 14 of the EH&s LSM serves as the CHP, so the EH&S LSM serves as the CHP when that section is completed*
	- Regulation WAC 296-828  
		- included in the EH&S LSM as Appendix A
	- lab specific SOPS
		- compressed gas
		- chemicals
		- laser
		- *more?*
	- chemical inventory
- SDSs for chemicals in the space


- general eh&s safety manual
	- check in lab if it includes the lab specific and emergency portion, and update in the eh&s lsm
	- emergency - pg 13
	- lab specific - pg 14
	- lab personnel - pg 16
- completed EH&S lab safety matrices for each lab member - completed and signed
- SDSs for all chemicals in the lab
- **359 - laser safety manual**
- **365 / 342 - biosafety manual** *i am actually not sure about this one, because it seems to pertain to medical / genetics / larger animal work, but we likely will still need one to cover - call ehs about it*
- **359 - laser safety procedure document**
- safe work practices and rules 
	- documented as general lab rules and included with SOPs in binders for EACH lab 
	- include PPE requirements

CHECK may be included as part of eh&s lsm, so these would just need to be updated, not added
- lab specific safety manual 
	- specific structure on pg 14 of the eh&s lsm, serves as the chemical hygiene plan
	- specific requirement checklist included in this *use when updating binder*
- emergency information page
	- pg 13 of eh&s lsm
##### Required in the Lab Specific CHP 
*part of the lab manual, but explicitly pointed out here for clarity*
*quoting from the EH&S LSM*
required in the lab specific CHP
- The safety requirements, either as laboratory rules or standard operating procedures (SOPs), including PPE requirements 
	- SOPs for laser in 359
	- SOPs for bio in 342 + 365
	- SOPs for compressed gas in 342 + 359
	- SOPs for chemicals in 342 *and 365? what work do they perform in there*
	- SOPs for emergency procedures (fire / spill / laser accident)
	- SOPs for fly handling
- Laboratory-specific topics, including hazardous environments, materials and equipment used, covered in the laboratory’s training program  
- Additional details specific to the laboratory and generally described on the laboratory-specific information at the beginning of the LSM 
#### Required in the lab safety manual
- hazard and risk assessment for lab tasks - described below
steps in identifying hazards and and assessing risk *required by EH&S LSM - quoting*
Steps in the assessment include: 
1. Research chemicals and processes to be used. 
2. Identify and evaluate all types of hazards involved. 
	Some evaluations to consider: 
	- what are the hazards? 
	- What is the worst that can happen? 
	- What can be done to prevent that? 
	- What can be done to minimize each risk?
	- What should be done if something goes wrong? 
1. Consider if additional hazards may be present, if scaling up 
2. Select controls to adequately lower the perceived risks, using the hierarchy of controls (starting with the most effective): 
	 - Eliminate hazardous substances and hazardous steps in the process (if possible)
	 - Substitute with less-hazardous chemicals, smaller quantities, and safer processes
	 - Implement engineering controls, such as local ventilation or remote controls
	 - Implement administrative controls, such as an after-hours policy during exceptionally hazardous processes
	 - As a last line of defense, assess PPE requirements 
		 - Refer to our website for additional guidance on general PPE practices. 
			*Additional information on hazard identification can be found in the document: 
				Identifying and Evaluating Hazards in Research Laboratories: Guidelines Developed by the Hazards Identification and Evaluation Task Force of the American Chemical Society’s Committee on Chemical Safety, 2013.
5. Ensure emergency response situations have been addressed:
	Hazards identified and assessment of risk should be documented for any new procedures, practices, or spaces involving usage of hazardous chemicals or materials. A risk assessment tool and guide are available on our website. *If the assessment results in requirements for controls, those requirements must be documented in lab protocols (as described in the following paragraph).* For best practices, it is recommended that the assessment be documented whether or not controls are required.

#### required safety trainings
- Compressed gas 
	- *Who?
- Laser
	- anyone who works with maui
	- the online laser safety training AND hands on laser safety training
- Managing laboratory chemicals
	- *who?
- Fire Extinguisher
	- everyone in the lab *does the lab have a fire extinguisher?*
- *More?*
in general, lab trainings are required for 1) general + lab specific training 2) specific chemical / hazard training 3) PPE training

each lab member needs a completed and signed EH&S lab training matrix (in each binder?)


### annually review and update the following
- UW EH&S LSM - check every DECEMBER for changes
- SOPs - check and review and update if needed
- MyChem inventory and available SDSs - check if current, remove if outdated
- internal inspections
- routine maintenance records - fire extinguisher expiration / safety shower maintenance 
- equipment conditions
- review and update CHP - brief lab if major changes occur

### NOTES
- CHP must be available at all times for personnel working in spaces with hazards 
	- *does this mean we need a binder in 359 as well?* **YES, we need a CHP in each room (must be accessible without needing a key from someone or leaving the lab space)**
- CHP must be reviewed and updated *annually*
- self inspections must be performed *annually*
- Additional manuals are required
	- Biosafety manual for 342 - 365?
	- laser safety manual for 359
- write SOP for laser alignment (using alignment guidelines) and operation
- RP - responsible party, is the PI in our case
- CHO - chemical hygiene officer, RP by default, but they can delegate it to someone else *i think this is lydia in our lab*
- list of chemicals in mychem must be reviewed *annually*
- self inspections need to be formal, and it would be useful to create a checklist that can be used
	- EH&S prepped checklist available - link on pg 25 EH&S LSM

- may require spill control (place on absorbent pad) for bench top if chemicals on bench top BUT sama wants to transition away from ethanol/apple cider vinegar traps anyways
- label gas lines in the lab - 342 needs labels for the gas coming to the fly plates from the co2 tanks
- all gas canisters need 'in use'/'half full'/'empty' tags
- does the lab produce chemical waste? if so, of what kind?

- is there an eyewash in 342? **NO**
- flush eyewash and document flush every week

- fire extinguishers need to be wall mounted
- ABC or BC (less powerful but less cleanup) extinguisher required
- do we need a flammable cabinet? why do we have ethanol, is it just for the traps that the lab is moving away from, or will it be an ongoing material we use and need to deal with storage and disposal of?

- required lab signs
	- lab caution sign
	- emergency procedures
	- lab layout / emergency equipment location signs
	- hazard warning signs
	- natural gas shut off (*only if a valve is present in the lab*)
	- nonpotable, do not drink on lab water
- 342 needs a suite sign, and 342 cold room may need a sign as well
- plexiglass holder required
- emergency response and spill response posters required (342 / 332? / 365? / 359)
- emergency contact numbers required to be posted (PI and lab personnel to be called (so sama lydia and myself))
- lab layout with locations of safety equipment required (342 / 359 / 365? /332?)
- specific laser warning sign required for 359 / possibly need biohazard sign for 342?
	- *i should call eh&s soon/tomorrow to figure out if drosophila research requires a biohazard sign / biosafety lab notebook / dead flies need biohazard bag etc*
- mold in cold rooms focus sheet included in LMS
	- remove cardboard / absorbent materials to get rid of mold
	- check humidity / lower ambient humidity
	- *could help with the troubleshooting*
- this may affect [[Work/Lab Notebook/Hub Notes/Projects/Maui|Maui]] - cannot penetrate ceiling tiles to run piping for compressed gas or liquid through them
- operating manuals with instruments (incubators / fly pads / 3d printer / maui etc)

continued safety notes - from pg 102

- [autoclave training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM_JTgLSKXk)
- [autoclaving biohazardous waste](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/autoclaving-biohazardous-waste-guidelines-98)
	- follow the guidelines in the attached document AND make a lab specific SOP for the autoclave
- talked to stephanie 
	- wang lab just throws bumblebees away OR freezes and then tosses octopi + crabs
		- they use a regular freezer, just needs to be labeled 'no food'
	- they dont have to label their animals / waste as biohazards, it would be good to ask other drosophila labs

- clothes
	- core body (no crops) and legs covered

- 3 trainings that are required for RP / CHO (cover developing SOPs etc)
	- [laboratory Safety Practices - Zoom](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/laboratory-safety-practices-zoom)
	- [Laboratory Safety Compliance - Online](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/laboratory-safety-compliance-online)
	- [Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) Hands-On Training](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/chemical-hygiene-officer-cho-hands-training)
i think sama, lydia and myself will have to complete these trainings 

required components of an SOP
- process or experiment description
- hazardous chemicals/class of hazardous chemicals
- PPE
- Engineering / Ventilation controls
- Special handling procedures and storage requirements
- spill and accident procedures
- waste disposal
- special procedures with animals (*do we need this?*)
- approval required (like what required trainings are needed)
- decontamination
- designated area
*use this as a framework when making SOPs*

sample sops available online, but MUST be edited to reflect the needs of the lab

STEPS TO DEVELOPING SOPs
1) modify existing SOPs
2) identify requirements
	- by process
	- by individual chemical
	- by class of chemical
3) complete the SOPs
4) file the SOPs (in paper + in the digital lab manual)

when updating SOPs, sign and note the revision date, and then alert all lab members of the revision

continuing LSM on pg 133
- must keep a log of all HAZARDOUS waste thats been treated for 6 years, and be able to provide it to EH&S on request
	- does this include flies? like gut instinct says no
- there is a laboratory safety checklist to use for self inspections + a safety inspection tool on the lab safety dashboard
	- record date of the self inspection, findings and follow up in paper or electronically for self inspections
- all chemical information needs to be kept for 30 years
- all other obsolete documents (old eyewash maintenance records, inventory that are not chemicals etc) keep for ?

Emergency procedures for the lab need to be developed and implemented
quoting from UW EH&S LSM

Prevent emergencies in laboratories and minimize the effects of an emergency by doing the following: 
1. Post emergency phone numbers, the Exposure Response Poster, and the Spill Response Poster. 
2. Identify the locations of emergency equipment on a floor plan; make sure all staff know the locations of the equipment, such as a spill kit. Templates to help create a single lab floorplan and a multi-room floorplan are available online. 
3. Keep access to emergency equipment and electrical panels unobstructed. 
4. Know locations of shutoffs for equipment including electrical, gas and water. 
5. Train personnel to retrieve SDSs for laboratory chemicals using MyChem. 
6. Separate incompatible chemicals—a chemical incompatibility chart is available online. 
7. Frequently dispose of chemical wastes and clean out unneeded chemicals and surplus; dispose of unneeded items. 
8. Ensure electrical wires and equipment are in good condition. 
9. Discuss accidents and near misses to prevent future accidents. 
10. Periodically complete the laboratory inspection checklists found online. 
11. Discuss safety topics periodically in staff meetings.

we need to label pipes + hoses *done already in 342, do in 359 when applicable* 

what would we do if the incubators die / mites take them over? do we have backup crosses or would we need to start from scratch

where is the information saved + backed up? is it multiple locations (machine/service dies or malfunctions)

flashlights if the power goes out

spill kits / fire extinguisher / emergency kit

if an accident needs to be reported, OARS MUST be used within 24 hours

EH&S emergency report number : 
- (8-5 weekdays) 206 543 7262
- (after hours, reach through UWPD) 206 685 8973
have these numbers posted in the lab for accident reporting 

do i need to have people practice reporting in OARS?

post spill response poster in main lab rooms (342 and 332)

get sheets / towels for the chemical shower?
get back up clothes for the chemical shower?
SUITE SIGN FOR THE HALLWAY

does our lab have natural gas?

there is a moving in checklist that would be a useful reference
