# Obsidian Use Guide

From 'Obsidian for Beginners' from Linking your Thinking

### 1/6
Double square bracket around a word / phrase to form a link
Use these links (backlinks) extensively - to link thinking it will help with memory and keep track of things in the lab notebook

### 2/6
6 Most Important Key in Markdown
1. The Link; [[]] - connect notes together, create a web of links
2. The Tag; # - to create a grouping of notes on a similar theme / project. command click on the tag to access all notes with this tag
3. Italics; *asterisks around words to get italics* can also ctrl+i
4. Bold; **double asterisks on both sides for bold** can also use ctrl+b
5. Lists; hyphen and space to create a list
6. Headers; # + spacebar. Add more hashtags to crate lower levels of heading

all extra characters disappear as you keep writing

### 3/6 
8 key settings *this video series uses an older version / mac version of obsidian, so some things are different than my version*

*all have been enabled (except starred, couldn't find it in plugins. maybe explore later*)
I believe stars have been replaced by bookmarks. 

Editor
1. Spellcheck 
Plugins
2. Tag Pane
3. Page Preview
4. Starred Notes
File
5. Deleted Files 
6. **Always Update Internal Links** - most important one
Appearance
7. Dark/Light
8. Custom CSS

### 4/6 
Custom Themes

other themes can make information in obsidian stick out more - different colors for different headings and text formatting etc

its meant to be fun, to be joyous and to be fun to work in

installed neon :3 she's fun, but I may change to something else for an everyday theme

### 5/6
Hotkeys
1. Open link while in edit mode (ctrl+click on link)
2. Toggle edit and preview mode (ctrl+e)
3. Open Quick Switched (ctrl+o)
4. Search (ctrl+shift+f) 
5. Back (ctrl+alt+left arrow)
6. Forward (ctrl+alt+right arrow)
7. New Note (ctrl+n)
8. Open note in new window (ctrl + click on a **note**)

also useful - drag the edges of windows to widen and shrink different panes

### 6/6
just go and DO it (pointed at creators, but enjoyable and useful for me othe places)

---
adding three hyphens in a row + a space creates a page break

single set square brackets followed by link in single set round brackets with NO SPACE BETWEEN = hyperlink ; [text you want to see]+(link for that text) with no space between
