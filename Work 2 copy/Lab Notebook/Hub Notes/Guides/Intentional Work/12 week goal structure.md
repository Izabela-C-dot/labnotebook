1. At week 0, identify an accountabuddy and an ambitious goal that you can achieve in 12 weeks. This goal should align with a grander, personal vision.
2. Next, write down a small list of actions that, if completed over the next 6 weeks, will move you closer to meeting your goal ([do less, do it better](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/do+less%2C+do+it+better)).
3. Each week (usually Monday morning), dedicate 2 hours for [time blocking](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/time+blocking) and protecting time for [deep work](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/deep+work) sessions.
4. Meet at the end of each week with your accountabuddy for troubleshooting, brainstorming, and celebrating ([effective project management requires introspection](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/effective+project+management+requires+introspection)).
5. At week 6, the halfway point, identify the next set of actions to complete.
6. Celebrate at week 12 and take time off to reflect.

*would there be a good replacement for an accountabuddy? why am i brushing off the idea of having one without trying? i shouldn't just assume it won't work for me*
