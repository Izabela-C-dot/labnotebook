projects will drift if not cared for, and this care requires open, honest and vulnerable self reflection

reflection helps align attention and intention. the [[weekly meetings with sama]] can help with this reflection, but doing so on your own will also be helpful and necessary

Questions to ask
- Am I on track to achieving my 12-week goal? ([[12 week goal structure]], [iterate on your first draft instead of aiming for perfection](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/iterate+on+your+first+draft+instead+of+aiming+for+perfection))
- How much time should I protect this week to work on this project? (see [time blocking](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/time+blocking) and [deep work](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/deep+work))
- When and where should I work?
- How will I know when I'm finished?
- What is one thing I can change to improve my workflows?

There's no point in working fast if it doesn't get you to where you need to be, and there's no point in working hard if you don't have to. 

You don't want to work **hard**, you want to work **smart**. 
Working smart requires self reflection.
