## order

- slides
- EH&S binders
## order 2
- ~~move tape back to 342
- ~~write down what im gonna do next week based on the bonsai meeting
- ~~make slides
- fill out more paperwork for the binders

## bonsai meeting
- in order to access opto on prometheus you ned to move the USB on the arduino
- blue is male and orange is female

- the ID model is weak AND the model keeps identifying the different lights as flies 
- SO 
	- take 10-20 (max 50) videos that are 1-5 minutes long
	- move the stadium lights around during the video
	- SLEAP train the model with variable lights (how to do this?)
- AND
	- for the ID model - take videos with clipped wings and unclipped wings to train the identity model
	- *need to buy some scissors to clip / how do other labs clip the wings*

- IDEAS
	- the model drops out when the fly rears up
		- change things in bonsai - if the fly rears up and model drops out have nothing change until the model comes back?
	- use bonsai to crop to the area of interest (the arena and the reporter LED)
		- try out and figure out how to do this - how to crop the image, this could remove the issue of false positives (other than the ones produced by the reporter LED)

get videos and try to crop the video at the same time - multiple avenues to try and solve the problems - work on it all at the same time
