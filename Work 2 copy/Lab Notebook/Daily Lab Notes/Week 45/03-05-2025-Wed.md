# to do
## safety inspection
- ~~make / scan floorplans and add to binder
- ~~print SDS
	- co2
	- atr
- ~~inspection walk around
## QOL
- tool box - what do we need for tools BEFORE we order a box
## etc
- signs
	- make signage for main lab spaces
	- NOT 403A
- python practice
- NSC documentation to sama
	- flex time plan *not priority*
- notebook check day 2 pizza
	- italiano, verdura primo, roman holiday, all 13 inch
## non-research goals
- finish logging flystocks
- safety binder 
	- ~~332
	- ~~342
- laser hazard walkthrough points
## troubleshoot incubation chambers
- HUMIDITY STILL TOO HIGH THIS MORNING
	- what to do now?
## laser hazard walkthrough deliverables
THINGS AMY WANTS
- light tight laser enclosure
	- *objects needed ordered*
- laser in use sign - switch the front sign piece to red in place of green
- what wavelength do we use?
	- alignment -
	- operation - 920 nm
- signage on the hallway doors - for emergency personnel to know the center rooms are occupied
	- building coordinator contact about this
	- *emailed william about this - reached out to amy about it*
- add karin to the binder
## hotcell
- its trial and error time!
	- take mary's single fly and boundary model + test a fly in it
	- take notes about what works and what doesnt
	- change parameters and see what changes
		- add snapshots of the workflow to my slides
- run flies in 3metheus to get short videos with variable lighting set up (to help stop the false positives)
## enki
- write an agora for enki *do this after princess is able to use him in a functional capacity*
	- how to build 
		- parts list
		- length of all tubes used
		- STL file for needle holder and sample holder?
	- how to use
	- how to maintain
	- troubleshooting
	- draw a schematic
- [[enki breakdown]] continue
## C priorities 
### agora additions
- write an agora - dictionary of all the short hand phrases on our fly stocks
- how to add flies to the stock list
	- translate fly stock notes
- how to add new people to maui?
	- PERSON
		- safety trainings
			- fire extinguisher
			- lab chemicals
			- compressed gas
			- laser worker safety
	- BINDER
		- add a new safety training matrix sheet
		- add a new safety training record sheet
		- add a new name + contact information to pg 16 of the LSM (personnel list)
### personal organization
- add og fly notes to obsidian
- add stock add notes to obsidian
- add balancer notes to obsidian
- add recombination notes to obsidian
- start document of questions and answers for the fly gene stuff
### safety
- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30
- safety binder assemble 365/332/342
- go through and address the notes in 2/16/2024 safety report on the lab safety dashboard
	- check that all feasible notes have been addressed
- update lab safety dashboard
### etc + long term projects
- sigmacote and jerseycote
	- work with EHS to determine how to get rid of the sigmacote ONCE I RECEIVE THE JERSEYCOTE, preferably by exchanging it / giving it to another lab on campus
- set up binder for packing slips

# notes
## order
- ~~finish up safety stuff
	- ~~scan floorplans and print them
		- ~~scan for 342
		- ~~make for 332
	- ~~add more page protectors to the weekly order sheet
	- ~~print SDSs and add to binder
		- CO2 
		- ~~ATR
	- ~~complete the inspection walk around
		- print out new copy (correct size) of the old inspection
		- from old one - only things not changed = sigmacote (in progress), note putting on valve caps when cylinders not in use (not wroth it), no laundry service (not worth it)
		- need to do a self inspection
		- SOPs for all included? whats a hazardous chemical that needs an SOP?
- check on 3metheus - open to use?
	- variable lighting videos - write own script or use a different one? 
	- record video + make sure the LED turns on and off
- humidity - manual and working on stuff

## order
- ~~eat bagel
- ~~safety walk around
- ~~lunch
- 3metheus *in use rn - make a plan for what to test - test out cropping*
- humidity
## cropping
- there is just a cropping modifier - could I just apply that right after the camera to focus on the arena?
- test out a non crop section, the ideal would be the arena+the indicator and nothing else
	- !! crop polygon! no need to fuck with training out the extra lights
## 3metheus plan 
- grab my two male flies
- write a script (turn the led indicator on and off, a crop polygon in order to cut out all but the indicator LED)
- record videos - short (1-2 minutes) take like 10 with the same flies

## humidity 
[[humidity troubleshooting]]
# done
- added page protectors to the order sheet
- email linde for co2 SDS
- atr SDS found and added to 332 binder
- added floorplans to binders and rooms (332 and 342) 
- safety overview walkthrough based on old inspection
- printed CO2 SDS
- made new fly traps for 342
- learned how to crop in bonsai - will apply tomorrow
- added yeast to order sheet
- finished 332 and 342 safety binders (before having them checked again)
# to do tomorrow
- **3metheus**
- check 365 for fly traps
- replace fly morgue in 365

- reprogram gabe to be 9-9
- move flies to gabe
- try humidity change, chamber off, door open (overnight)

- figure out returning the box
- get more WT flies from mateo to revamp my bottles
