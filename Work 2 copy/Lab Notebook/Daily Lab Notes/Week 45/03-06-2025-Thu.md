- safety binder assemble 365/332/342
- go through and address the notes in 2/16/2024 safety report on the lab safety dashboard
	- check that all feasible notes have been addressed
- update lab safety dashboard
### etc + long term projects
- sigmacote and jerseycote
	- work with EHS to determine how to get rid of the sigmacote ONCE I RECEIVE THE JERSEYCOTE, preferably by exchanging it / giving it to another lab on campus
- set up binder for packing slips


# notes

## order
- ~~br
- ~~3metheus set up
- reach out to people with flies - change to gabe?
- reach out to tu - got a fedex notification on tuesday, said id get the package from central yesterday, still no package

## order
- ~~br
- ~~reach out to tu - flies
- sleap learning - what do i do now that i have the videos?
- humidity - make a plan
## 3metheus
- i feel like the turning on and off is important to be trained out, like it wont work the same with just it fully on 
	- does it turning on have a flare effect that makes it look different / could still be registered as a fly if we dont train it out
- crop the space to just the arena and the light
	- what if theres an issue with the frame being a different shape fucking with sleap?
		- we'll just try and see, its all low stakes stuff at this point, its all learning

## sleap
- is this a **mac apple silicon** or a mac intel

# done
- wrote script for light training videos
	- learned cropping + got mateos help to figure out turning on and off the LED
	- got cropped videos and uncropped videos with on and off indicator LED (in case messing with the shape of the video fucks with SLEAP)
- messaging about beelzebub - moving flies and changing the timer
- emailed william for mateo, nastacia and i to get key card access again
- messaged tu - flies
- emailed UW mailing services about getting the package of flies
- sleap reading
- installed miniforge (step to install sleap)
# to do tomorrow
- make slides
- change gabriel, move flies, off and open beelzebub
- replace fly traps in 365
- install sleap
