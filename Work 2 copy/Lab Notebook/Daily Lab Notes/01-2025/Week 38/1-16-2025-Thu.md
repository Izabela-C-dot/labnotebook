## laser hazard walkthrough deliverables
THINGS AMY WANTS
- light tight laser enclosure
- send amy the LSP
	- she will help me update it
	- she will help me write the alignment guide
		- *read the edits amy has made to the LSP*
- laser in use sign - switch the front sign piece to red in place of green
- what wavelength do we use?
	- alignment -
	- operation - 920 nm
- replace the purple goggles 
	- check the operating wavelength and make sure the goggles suit the wavelength
		- *find out what alignment wavelength we use so i can get goggles that cover both operation and alignment*
	- buy 2 new pairs of goggles
- signage on the hallway doors - for emergency personnel to know the center rooms are occupied
	- building coordinator contact about this
## hotcell
- [[hotcell list]] 
- ~~learn how to use github
- ~~get added to ahmed github
- bonsai - ahmed github
	- how does it work basically?
	- what in hotcell would be interacting with it?
- sleap - ahmed github
	- how does it basically work?
	- what in hotcell is interacting with it?
## enki
- write an agora for enki *do this after princess is able to use him in a functional capacity*
	- how to build 
		- parts list
		- length of all tubes used
		- STL file for needle holder and sample holder?
	- how to use
	- how to maintain
	- troubleshooting
	- draw a schematic
- [[enki breakdown]] continue
## C priorities 
### agora additions
- write an agora - dictionary of all the short hand phrases on our fly stocks
- how to add flies to the stock list
	- translate fly stock notes
- how to add new people to maui?
	- PERSON
		- safety trainings
			- fire extinguisher
			- lab chemicals
			- compressed gas
			- laser worker safety
	- BINDER
		- add a new safety training matrix sheet
		- add a new safety training record sheet
		- add a new name + contact information to pg 16 of the LSM (personnel list)
### personal organization
- add og fly notes to obsidian
- add stock add notes to obsidian
- add balancer notes to obsidian
- add recombination notes to obsidian
- start document of questions and answers for the fly gene stuff
### safety
- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30
- safety binder assemble 365/332/342
- go through and address the notes in 2/16/2024 safety report on the lab safety dashboard
	- check that all feasible notes have been addressed
- update lab safety dashboard
### etc + long term projects
- sigmacote and jerseycote
	- work with EHS to determine how to get rid of the sigmacote ONCE I RECEIVE THE JERSEYCOTE, preferably by exchanging it / giving it to another lab on campus
- set up binder for packing slips
# notes

## fly prints
- the trick is to get it off the raft soon after (immediately after) it finishes printing so it doesnt solidify too hard to it
- one left for minimum meet!

## kid visit
- yay! larva on the walls for the 1.10 bottles! they dont need to be virgins, so when they eclose grab them all, group house some and isolation house others, all on ATR
## order
- ~~start raft print
- ~~water
- *literally write out what you are thinking + what you think you need to do and the obstacles + talk to sama about it - its better to ask now than to wait and delay progress*
- read the hotcell list + write more questions
- hotcell code
- hotcell videos
- kid visit checking + talking to M and P

## hotcell planning
OKAY - i will start by learning how to use github + getting added to the Ahmed github, which will then let me start learning how to use sleap and bonsai WHICH WILL THEN allow me to troubleshoot sleap and bonsai
- get access to the ahmed github repo + then GENERATE QUESTIONS TO ASK PEOPLE

## order2
- ~~fly model 3 
- ~~pick up and cap fly food
- ~~split BDSC flies (find 12/12, pre12/12 order info from sama)
- ~~github intro
## incubator
- ran into rich he said
	- 1) try cleaning the reservoir - details on how to do this in the manual
	- 2) the blinking light is what the machine does when it is trying to heat - ultrasonic heater
- okay!

## kid notes from email
- find things in the lab to look at under the microscope - unlike everyday objects
	- lay off the microscope stuff, good so we can focus on the larva + the adult flies

## order 3
- ~~read bonsai introduction
- kid visit stuff
	- look for things 
	- check for function
	- message princess and mateo

## hotcell
- is there anyway for me to read the bonzeb + look at the bonsai code for hotcell at the same time? I want to understand what each of the nodes is doing - maybe notate

prometheus is disassembled rn - so what can i do in the interim?
- look at the github and try and understand from there
- ask mary about the frequency filter - what did it do?
- ask more people on what to do - look over git hub and tutorials and generate questions to ask lab members

tell mary and sama what i am up to, what i plan on doing, and ask if they have any suggestions in where i should point myself further
