## kid notes from meeting with sama
- princess has an nsyb>GCaMP cross already set up - reach out to her to get a flip of it
	- if i get this by 1/18 (ie 5 days before the kid visit) i will have larva i can use
- check the video camera on the microscope station
- check that i can access yellow light (tdtom) or blue light (GCaMP) to trigger the glow in the nsyb larva
	- *what lights are used to trigger this? where are they?*
- grab the 2p goggles for the kids to use during the light up portion
- check that we have sucrose in 332
	- no sucrose? order some

flies from the cross bottles should eclose on the 20th 
- isolate a few on ATR
- put the rest in group housing on ATR - no need to make sure they're virgins, just grab everyone
