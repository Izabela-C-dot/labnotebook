# notes
## order
- ~~packages
- ~~lunch
- hotcell
- kid stuff (main - email to parent with information and questions // send prep documents to princess and mateo)

## safety documentation
eyewash flushing logs can be tossed after a year - check our log page and see when i can toss the old one

## why am i reading papers in the powerpoint?
- i want to gain a deeper understanding of why we are doing this / how we are doing it different than previous work
	- looking at previous work i think will give me a better understanding of what to try / what not to try with troubleshooting - it gives me more of a grounding in the project to look at the sources mary linked that inspired the project
		- *i want to really understand what's happening and what i am doing with this - i feel like thats the best way for me to get something out of this and the best way to do robust troubleshooting (informed troubleshooting)*
- i want to learn the base information and go from there - first principals and work forwards
# done
