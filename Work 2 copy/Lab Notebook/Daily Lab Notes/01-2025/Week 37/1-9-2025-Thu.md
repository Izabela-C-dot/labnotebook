THINGS AMY WANTS
- light tight laser enclosure
- send amy the LSP
	- she will help me update it
	- she will help me write the alignment guide
		- *read the edits amy has made to the LSP*
- laser in use sign - switch the front sign piece to red in place of green
- what wavelength do we use?
	- alignment -
	- operation - 920 nm
- replace the purple goggles 
	- check the operating wavelength and make sure the goggles suit the wavelength
		- *find out what alignment wavelength we use so i can get goggles that cover both operation and alignment*
	- buy 2 new pairs of goggles
- signage on the hallway doors - for emergency personnel to know the center rooms are occupied
	- building coordinator contact about this

## enki
- write an agora for enki *do this after princess is able to use him in a functional capacity*
	- how to build 
		- parts list
		- length of all tubes used
		- STL file for needle holder and sample holder?
	- how to use
	- how to maintain
	- troubleshooting
	- draw a schematic
- [[enki breakdown]] continue
## C priorities 
### agora additions
- write an agora - dictionary of all the short hand phrases on our fly stocks
- how to add flies to the stock list
	- translate fly stock notes
- how to add new people to maui?
	- PERSON
		- safety trainings
			- fire extinguisher
			- lab chemicals
			- compressed gas
			- laser worker safety
	- BINDER
		- add a new safety training matrix sheet
		- add a new safety training record sheet

### safety
- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels

# notes
## priorities
- ~~switch out filters on the incubators
- ~~BDSC order process

- kid visit planning and documentation
## kid visit
- get virgin ppk-chr females? (i think it would be easier to get moonwalker virgins - so get those) - does it matter here?
- set up a cross - flip and try to get flies
	- work through the genetic math here to make sure i am getting the correct genotype
- cross moonwalker with UAS-chr
## order
- go to 342
	- read on what to do
	- prep what to do
- kid visit
	- document make - what do i need to do? what do i need to learn? etc
## incubator change notes
B water not heating as well as G (the water in B is not shimmering like Gs)
Red light in B water heater 'blinking' (going between low and high intensity, not ever really turning off)
B water is foamy / has a ring around the top of the water level

sent the manual to rich
**ill check about cleaning the reservoirs**

it seems like the water in B isnt heating correctly - maybe that could be connected to too much humidity (ie never off, the B heater is just constantly on and constantly pumping in humidity maybe?)
# done
- BDSC flies ordered!
- prepped for filter change
- incubator filters changed out!
- sent incubator manual to rich
# to do tomorrow
- kid planning 
- 3metheus meeting

- check about cleaning the incubator reservoirs
- wipe out inside of incubator
- update agora with filter change information
