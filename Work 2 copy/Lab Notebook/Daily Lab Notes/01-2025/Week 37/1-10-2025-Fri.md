# note
## kid visit cross
-  i have moonwalker-gal4 flies in a *vial? bottle?* and i need to find UAS-Chr flies
	- which does it make sense to use females (which need to be virgin) and which does it make sense to use males?
	- preference - need to set up the actual cross as quickly as possible, so i need virgin females as quickly as possible
		- which genotype can produce virgins faster?

OKAY so the vial of moonwalker-gal4 and fru-gal4 have been flipped recently and karins UAS-Chr were flipped 1/6
- i am concerned about being able to prep the cross in time because we don't have any virgins on EITHER cross emerging soon (due to the recent flips)
	- what if i use a different UAS-Chr stock from the supply that would be able to give virgins sooner?

if i sent up the moonwalker-chr cross today i MIGHT be able to have flies by the 23rd, but if i dont have virgins i cant do anything

**OKAY** mateo has UAS-Chr for me to use yay! i can set up crosses today! yay!
- 2 bottles of moonwalker-chr, 2 bottles of fru-chr set up TODAY to flip on monday/tuesday
**OKAY** i have set up 2 bottles each - will talk to sama about timing
