# notes
## order
- ~~humidity check on beez
- ~~install sleap
- start training the crop model - train the led out
## humidity
- beez turned back on 11:03 AM
- check at 2ish - after lunch to see where we're at
- 1ish - hit 70% and kept climbing
## sleap 
oh my god its just soup - i have no idea what it is asking me to do to just install this, but i sure am trying - we'll see if this is worth it or if i should focus more on fly forward stuff during my 1-1

OKAY i have miniforge installed - how do i install sleap

am i supposed to enter the sleap call into the conda terminal , which wont let me type anything , or the regular terminal, which keeps failing (failure to write)

OKAY  going from basics and downloading anaconda

OKAY I GOT ANACONDA AND I WAS ABLE TO RUN THE INSTALLER IN JUPYTER (I THINK)
will this actually matter, will this actually help me and will i be able to run it in my regular terminal

YES I GOT IT TO WORKKKKKK GOD YES

im going to restart my computer and see if i can open it again

## order 2
- move the videos from 365 to the ahmed lab server
- start training a sleap model
- ~~1:30 meeting
- ~~check beez
- eat lunch

## order 3
- ~~lunch
- bonsai script grab for 365 - single fly and boundary 
	- if its there, perfect - run something 
	- if its not, make something and test it
## bonsai
- which of these scripts is the single fly?
- look at the sleap model being accessed by the script - is it built for 1 or 2 flies
- OKAY i think its the sleap model that needs to be changed to be 1 fly and not multiple

## humidity
OKAY! i think the humidity on beez is still busted 
whats the quote darwin gave us originally?

reading back the emails i sent to darwin when originally working on this 
- no active drying 
- check for water collecting in the evaporator pan 
	- unscrew 7 screws 
	- let the fan face plate swing down
	- gain access to the evaporator pan and check for water
# done
- installed anaconda
- installed sleap
	- GOD and i can open it up again oh my god
- meeting with sama
- wrote [[post 3.10.2025 notes]]
- checked humidity on beez
- replaced fly traps in 365
- grabbed 365 bonsai scripts to try and figure out which is single fly and boundary
# to do tomorrow
- weeklys
	- flush eyewash
	- order objects
	- order fly food
- figure out bugs - check food boxes for food mites THEN order
- check humidity
	- unscrew the fan face plate and check the evaporator pan for water
