## fly food and eggs 
saw the little orange eggs in the boxes of fly food from 2/14 - but not the unlabeled box
1 2/14 tray had food that looked cloudy, and a different texture than all other batches. the cloudyness looked white, like a mold, so i tossed it all. ordering new food to replace it, tossing the egg boxes.

keeping the second 2/14 vials, NOT the box with eggs, because that food looks like the right texture

eggs on the quarantine box, switched to a new box, tossed the old

got mateo to do food tomorrow so we can be up and good to go
