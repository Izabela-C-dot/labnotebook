# To Do
- Continue condensing LSM notes into checklists
	- Rooms - start making lists to order / change
	- Safety Manual - making lists of things needed 
- Start knocking things off those checklists 

- ~~11:30-12:30 Journal Club
- ~~2:30-4:00 SafeCampus Violence prevention
- ~~4:35 meeting with sama and Hibah

# Notes
Questions
- Do all lab meetings for the next quarter get booked at the same time?
- Where is the ethanol?

- The lab safety dashboard says that we purchased 2 spill kits, but the orders and purchases sheet doesn't show any spill kits

For spill kits, we have all solid chemicals - except ethanol - which is an alcohol. no acids or bases, even when the salts are used to make liquids. Largest concern is sweeping up chemicals into appropriate bags, so bags / ppe / some absorbent pads needed (i think both 332 and 342 already have brooms + dustpans)

it makes the most sense to me to get 2 cheap single use spill kits (aimed towards liquid spills) and then also stock the labs with disposal bags with dry chemical spills

## Spill Kit Planning
Contents of our spill kits
- Disposable liquid spill kit
	- PIGÂ® Lab and Chemical Cleanup Kits, New Pig - on VWR for $38.58 each / need 2 (*but do we? maybe we just need one depending on where the ethanol actually is*)
		- No ethanol in 332 (from what I can see) - despite mychem saying it is in there
- dust pan and broom
	- Have two, one in 342 and one in 332
- goggles *splash safe + over the glasses compatible*
	- Honeywell Uvex Ademco OTG - on amazon for $7.14 each / need 2
- lightweight gloves
	- *check and make sure they are compatible with the dry chemicals*
	- nitrile rubber works for everything but full exposure ethanol (good for splash exposure ethanol) so nitrile rubber is solid
	- we have some in 332, just throw a few pairs in the bucket
- plastic bags
	- We have trash bags in 342, take a few out of the pack and put them in the kit
- hazardous waste labels
	- Downloadable from EH&S website
- Bucket with lid
	- 5 gallon bucket w/ lid - on amazon for $6.99 each / need 2

Are we making liquid solutions with the solid chemicals and should we add absorbent pads in case of spills?
- Brady SPC ABSORBENTS - on grainger for $33.69 per roll / need 1

Buy for spill kit
- 2 pairs goggles
- 2 buckets with lid
- *absorbent pads*
- *chemical clean up kit*

(found autoclave compatible bags - don't know if i should save them to use or if we want to lean more towards getting a freezer and disposing of flies that way BUT what if we need to autoclave after we freeze anyways??)
- WE HAVE AUTOCLAVE BAGS IN 332 - loose, but they say they can be autoclaved
---
reading maui protocols, looks like we will still have ethanol in the lab for various appkications - means we need to FIND IT and find a flammable proof container for it

---
# Done
- researching spill kit contents + requirements
- journal club
- spill kit research and notes
- updated required trainings spread sheet w/ list of required trainings for each role included
	- added links to this list in the agora
	- sent a twist message out about this to everyone in the lab
- reading maui protocols
- completed safe campus violence prevention
- had 1-1 meeting with sama and hibah, have things to do recorded in [[post 5.15.2024]]
