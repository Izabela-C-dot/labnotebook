## To Do
- ~~make slides for sama 1-1

- ~~get in touch with tu about a new procard
	- sent a checking in email to tu
	- got an email in response - seems to say no card until July, and then maybe. Forwarded to sama and Hibah
	- RESOLUTION: no new procard until September, follow Tu's lead with ordering (sending Tu links when we need to order something)

- **read through LSM notes and turn into checklists**
	- read notes 
	- condense notes
	- turn into action items list
	- begin to go through the list

- read through the twist
- read through the agora

- try and get printing set up
	- *on the LAB computer, so on Hibah's mac. hold off on this until then*

- ~~flush eyewash
	- there are no fire extinguishers in 332 or 342
	- 332 needs a non potable water sign
## Notes

Questions
1) do all of the lab meetings + bookings need to get done at the same time? if so, do I do this at the beginning of each quarter?
