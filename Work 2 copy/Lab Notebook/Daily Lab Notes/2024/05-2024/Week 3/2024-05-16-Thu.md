# To Do
- ~~write [[post 5.15.2024]] based off my 1-1 with sama and Hibah
	- tasks from that!
## Purchases and Orders
- Get access to the ahmed lab drive
	- Watch workday video hibah made
- ~~Make a draft lab shared purchases sheet based on loose plan in [[post 5.15.2024]]

## Karin's Project
- Reach out to Karin and see if there is a good day / time (likely post symposium) where she can explain the protocol  AND WHY WE'RE DOING THE EXPERIMENT to me so I can read over it and come up with questions to clarify before she leaves
	- read over protocol, write clarifying questions, ask and notate with answers

- ~~Reread Dros primer again

- *Post 5/17* if Hibah doesn't have time to start fly training me on friday, reach out to Lydia / Mary / Karin for training on sexing + pushing flies + anything else that Karin's protocols would require

## Safety Project 
- Go through lists and start completing things 
	- Generate questions to ask EH&S
		- what do other fly labs do with their dead flies? 
		- how many fire extinguishers do we need and in what rooms?
## Etc
- ~~Read agora 
	- skimmed titles + read some relevant pages
- ~~read twist (*try and get done today so it's not lingering*)

# Notes
## Purchases and Orders
- maybe make a sheet where lines get moved to orders and purchases once the order has been received? or at least removed from the doc? 
- maybe a new sheet is added for each week? - i want it to be very easy to see what is happening and clean
- name rn - weekly purchases - (i want it and the orders and purchases sheet to be clear and distinct from each other)

OO maybe a section for consumable checks? or a different process - but some kind of consumable check and add section
- to keep the weekly purchases sheet easy to use + clear, i will not include a consumable check zone, but it would be good to make a list of consumables + a process of going and checking on status every week / few days
- consumable check process added to [[OUTDATED - Long Term Projects]]

instead of keeping individual sheets for weeks, keep a current week sheet and then copy it to 'past weeks' once the new week is happening, so new orders can happen in a new and clean location, but the older ones are still viewable with the newest ON TOP (ie insert however many rows, then paste) (then move to the purchases and orders sheet once the week is past)

NO if i do a 'past orders' sheet it could get confusing, with orders being added to the wrong sheet and then getting moved to the past and not processed. I think its fine to have a lot of short sheets, that way its really easy to look back and what was done when (like how i did it at the autism center) - its not like they take up space, and it will make it easier to find things

also, maybe once enough time has passed (like a month or whatever) i could just condense it into month sheets instead of week sheets - but this is something that can be worked on

iterating on the first draft! not trying to make it perfect immediately!

attempting to connect to the ahmed lab server via big ip edge client
- can i use the same f5 big ip edge client that i have for husky on net? im not sure, because it doesn't seem to have the button to add a new server
- chat with UW IT went nowhere
	- emailed uw psych department to try and get in touch with departmental it
		- heard back, sent another email trying to get in contact. 
		- learned Shawn Heide is the IT person for the psych department
	- twist messaged hibah about it to ask for help
		- got response from hibah, working on it

reading through twist, most notes are on maui and in [[Work/Lab Notebook/Hub Notes/Projects/Maui|Maui]]
theres a twist thread (in behavior rigs - build fly chambers from acrylic sheets) that says we have acetone - but there's no acetone in out MyChem

i need to get hibah to show me the group lab space tomorrow

# Done
- Sent check in email to biokeys for LSB access
- Sent Karin a message on twist to start movement on understanding her project
- trying to get access to ahmedlab server through big ip edge client, working with UW psych department and hibah

- wrote [[post 5.15.2024]] and started [[Preliminary PS notes]]

- Made new weekly purchases template + purchase system to discuss with sama the week of the 27th
- Wrote a plan for making a consumables purchasing system - where i can check once a week and make sure we're always fully stocked. added to consumables sheet on [[OUTDATED - Long Term Projects]]

- Reading through the twist on maui, taking notes in [[Work/Lab Notebook/Hub Notes/Projects/Maui|Maui]]
- FINISHED reading through the twist and skimming the agora for relevant things

- Reviewed Drosophila primer and watched flipping videos

# To Do Tomorrow

Karin project - reach out / get in contact

fly training with hibah 
hibah shows me the joint lab space, where the ethanol + acetone is I assume

keep trying to log into the ahmed lab server

safety project - making lists and following through on the lists
