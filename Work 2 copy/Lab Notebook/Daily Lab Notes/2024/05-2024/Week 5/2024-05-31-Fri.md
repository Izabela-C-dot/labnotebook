how does the nonfly trash get thrown away? who's in charge of it, and who does it? can i just do it? 
- sal says i can just toss it. if its in a clear bag, put it next to the trash cans, if its a black bag take it out yourself

can atr go down the sink drain? (look at sds)

ask sama about the beakers - they are incorrect, but how bad is that?

things to order
- ~~silicone sponges 
- ~~black 3d printer filament
- ~~lab tape
- new beakers *asked sama he said to go ahead and order
- ~~kimwipes
- digital thermometer (karin send me a link)

10:30 - collect virgins with karin, then do a dry run of the protocol
3:00 - meet with mary in 342 to talk about crosses

refill little flug box in 332

toss apple cider traps from 342
get a box for big flugs in 342 (for yeast traps)

## flipping and collecting virgins
flipping bottles every 2-3 days, and collecting virgins from the older bottles that you flipped a week ago

collect virgins every day on the clock method - in the afternoon and in the morning
collect virgins EVERY DAY - every 8 hours (females virgins for 8 hours at 25 degrees and 18 hours at 18 degrees)

keep collecting virgins out of a bottle until you stop getting virgins and other bottles are producing flies

virgins are aged on regular food, flies placed on ATR after they are crossed

---
## IMPORTANT
karin WON'T be here next week, so check over shit with her
- what's the timing on things, explain things as I understand them - I am collecting virgins, who are aged on regular food, and then in a few days tested in the arena OR do i still need to set up crosses with here flies before they are ready to be tested

OKAY 

after meeting with her, we're gathering parents, need to setup the cross (male GAL4 - female ppk) and then THOSE virgin females will be used in tests

i will also set up a cross for mary, who will give me details today
