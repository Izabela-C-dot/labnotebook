# Notes

## Copying notes over
- copied autoclave instructions into [[Dead Fly disposal]]
	- write a new agora page on fly disposal
	- ~~get autoclave bags (sent to tu)

## black 3.0 test
- its dark on the paper + on the resin, i think the finish gets messed up whenever you touch it
- the paint wears off easily, and is easily damaged by hands touching it, is it as bad when the flies touch it?
- i mean, adding a finish coat would be the obvious solution, but that would mess with the matte finish (according to the culture hustle website)
- what matters more, not needing to keep repainting, or the matte finish? (my thought is the matte, to prevent glare in the recordings, provide a clean backdrop for the computer to track the flies)
- why was it not opaque? my guess, the brush was too scratchy, and removing paint as it was applying it

## things to order
- new fly gun tips
- new paint brushes
- new paper towels
- a lab coat in my size
- gloves in my size
