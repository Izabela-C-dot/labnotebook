## Personal Space
- ~~Make ATR food with Karin

- Go thorugh notes and make lists
	- documents that need to be included in the lab binders
	- ~~objects that need to be present in the lab 
- Write down my thoughts and make a plan of attack 
	- cut things into small chunks, and start SOMEWHERE

- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30
## Consumables Project
- look over the sheet again and reorganize
	- format the sheet so individual rows can be copied and pasted into the weekly purchases sheet
- clarify the consumables on the list - brands, sizes, specifications that are important
- recheck the consumables list and add things
- add secondary vendor for consumables 
- introduce list to lab members  
	- ask them to read over it and add things

mm looks like this isnt available, looking for an alternative rn. i want to just find a kit that has everything I need instead of trying to assemble one myself

## notes from atr food 

## etc notes brought up during atr food

how does the nonfly trash get thrown away? who's in charge of it, and who does it? can i just do it? 
- sal says i can just toss it. if its in a clear bag, put it next to the trash cans, if its a black bag take it out yourself

can atr go down the sink drain? (look at sds)

ask sama about the beakers - they are incorrect, but how bad is that?

things to order
- silicone sponges 
- black 3d printer filament
- lab tape
- new beakers
- kimwipes
- digital thermometer (karin send me a link)

10:30 - collect virgins with karin, then do a dry run of the protocol
3:00 - meet with mary in 342 to talk about crosses

refill little flug box in 332

toss apple cider traps from 342
get a box for big flugs in 342 (for yeast traps)

## flipping and collecting virgins
flipping bottles every 2-3 days, and collecting virgins from the older bottles that you flipped a week ago

collect virgins every day on the clock method - in the afternoon and in the morning
collect virgins EVERY DAY - every 8 hours (females virgins for 8 hours at 25 degrees and 18 hours at 18 degrees)

keep collecting virgins out of a bottle until you stop getting virgins and other bottles are producing flies

virgins are aged on regular food, flies placed on ATR after they are crossed
