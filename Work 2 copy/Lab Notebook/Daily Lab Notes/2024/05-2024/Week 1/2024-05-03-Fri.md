### Goals for the Day
- ~~I-9 with Melissa~~
	- ~~ask hourly or salary (which affects the 10-6/10-630 thing)~~
		- **i am salary, but i still need to work to 6:30 - so i may switch to 9-5:30 / 8-4:30**
	- ask to be added to the registry so i can get keys to 332 and 365
- Ask sama about flex hours (40 hours a week total or 8 hours a day, can I work more one day to leave early another etc)
	- **yes! can do this :)**

- **Hibah out today, but available remotely** so no direct shadowing, continuing work on general lab supplies list (asked her for guidance if what i was doing it correctly or not)

- ~~set up access to the dropbox and other lab resources (check email for permissions from sama)~~

- safety trainings
	- trainings
	- sops
	- LSM
- finish drosophila primer w/ notes (finish first read, then second read with light notes - can always do more later if need be)

- go through old threads on twist and look over them 
- go thorugh the agora *getting a sense of what has happened in the lab in the past, building up my knowledge and familiarity*

### Notes
Hibah's out today, told me that sama is handling fly food pickup today so I don't have to handle that today

#### How am I organizing 'ahmed lab - orders and supplies'?
- I am organizing all the orders in the first two pages of the sheet ('2022-2023' and 2024) into three separate sheets ('bio supplies', 'general lab supplies' and 'consumables')
- What is a 'bio supply'? *this is my first classification attempt, i asked Hibah (5/3/2024) if this is correct, and will change this based on her guidelines*
	- all materials that would touch flies or touch something that touches flies 
	- all vials, tubing, fixtures for tubing, anything from 'flystuff', parafilm 
	- bio supplies include consumables (tubes and pipette tips) that are not filtered out
- general lab supplies and consumables are everything that are not bio supplies (shelves, computer parts, lenses, mechanical fixtures, soap, chemicals etc)


### Done
- Joined the lab dropbox - not sure what I don't have access to yet, I'll keep notes and check it out
- I-9
- Finished organizing orders and supplies - waiting for hibah notes (if she has any, i'll change how i organized it)
- Read safety trainings (struck through in [[On-Boarding]])
