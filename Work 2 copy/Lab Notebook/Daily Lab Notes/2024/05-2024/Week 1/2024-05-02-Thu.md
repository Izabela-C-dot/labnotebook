### Goals for the Day?
- Shadow Hibah, ask questions, transfer answers from analog notebook to digital notebook
### Notes
Met with Hibah and sama
	- get keys to 332 and 365
		- label keys once I get the last two
	- ask Melissa tomorrow during I-9 about 10-6 vs. 10-6:30
	- purchasing orders sheet and going over ordering vials

I need to condense the notes I took while talking with Hibah into this lab page, and order my thoughts a little better

What do I need to do right now?
- go through the notes i wrote while talking to hibah
- make sure I have access to all of the lab documents and save them somewhere i can get to them easily (links in a hub note to all of the spread sheets)
- general lab supplies ordering sheet (look through and think about how to organize)

- go through the agora
	- chancellorships 
- go through the twist (active and old threads)
- go through the google drive
- go through old group meeting notes / calendars / reflections

- safety trainings

I need to go through the agora, the twist, and the google drive, but it's overwhelming to just say that. so i need a plan on how to do that. i need to order things for myself by priority.

first priority - move notes i took while talking to Hibah into my lab notebook

fly food and issues
- communication breakdowns have caused issues
- going in to pick up fly food tomorrow with hibah post lab meeting
- plug the food and clean things to protect from dust mites, which are the enemy

look at the chancellorships on the agora, specifically at hibah's and get ready to take over for her

hibah is going to transfer information about representatives and purchasing to me

there is a secret remote option - let sama know - not always and not often, but if i need to its an option

**never delete, close and annotate, but do not delete**

look through twist channels and old twist threads for context on projects in the lab. 
**as a research tech, i need to be on top of all of the projects in the lab at least a little in order to be able to assist with them**

how to add to the agora
- write an obsidian page
- share the obsidian page to the agora folder on the lab dropbox

on the orders and supply sheet - work on the general lab supplies section (*work on this today*)

ON orders - keep packing slips digitally (take photos of them and then upload those photos)
