(this is the heading for daily notes for the lab notebook, more format details in [[Notetaking]])

The lab notebook is a legal document that belongs to the lab, and must be saved to the dropbox, and reviewed by other members of the lab periodically (with sama ahmed during offboarding)

Information is never deleted from the lab notebook. If an entry is incorrect, add a **dated annotation or clarification** which helps preserve a transparent record of work in the lab

### What are my goals for today?
- Develop a better understanding of [[Obsidian]] (primer videos on agora)
- Develop an understanding of [[Twist]] (videos sama shared with me in twist dms)
- Develop criteria for [[Notetaking]] (hub notes, backlinking, modular notes etc)
