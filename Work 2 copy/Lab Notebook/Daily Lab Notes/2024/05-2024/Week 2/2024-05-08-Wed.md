### To Do
- ~~send a circular photo to lydia for her presentation
	- photo made, waiting for twist response on how to send it to her
	- sent link to her, said to contact me if she has issues accessing it
- ~~11:30 journal club meeting~~
- ~~2:00 1-1 with sama, Hibah out today, but he and I will still meet
	- [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_yH1OHZiIlRCxts4JmYj2JR_7KX_4S88gOB2py5jxeI/edit?usp=sharing)
- ~~finish reading drosophila primer
	- no notes taken, but i did some light further reading on gene expression
- Read LSM
	- general EH&S document
		- take notes if theres anything about 1) what needs to be included in a lab 2) what needs to be included in a lab safety binder 3) what needs to be included in a lab safety manual
	- specific lab safety document 
		- *needs to be updated, just a structure rn. edit plan below*
	- SOPs 
		- *only exist for covid + inspections*
		- *write (safety) SOPs for chemical handling / laser handling and (operational) SOPs for lab tasks / microscope operations / laser operations / sleap modeling / flipping etc - look into the agoa to pull documentation for these SOPs*
		- *add safety SOPs to the lab binder*
	- SDSs
		- *need to get on MyChem for these, add SDSs to the lab binder and to the google drive*
- Continue going through the twist
- Go thorugh the Agora (protocols and chancellorships to prep for taking Hibah's)

### Notes
from lab website - it's not 'can some flies multitask and others can't' its 'why can some tasks be done simultaneously without changes in attention / quality (ie talking and walking vs. talking and sitting) but others cant (texting and driving)'
- how do neural circuits interact when multiple behaviors happen at the same time?
- what aspects of neural activity limit the performance of different behaviors?
- what do these limits teach us about how the nervous system functions?

also really cool to note, the lab talks about challenging prevailing lab cultures on the research page! a creative space to get rid of the patterns that toxify academia - value intentionality, humility, imagination

post 1-1 with sama
1. take over more of hibah's responsibilities and have her check me as i do them
2. *get a new procard - talk to tu
	- emailed tu to ask about getting a new procard
3. *autoclave fly bags - talk to william if hibah can't get anything from sal
	- reached out to william kaplan to see who we can contact about using the autoclave on the fourth floor 
4. *hazcom signs for 359 and 365
	- called eh&s to add 365+359 to our mychem so we can generate a hazard sign
	- waiting to receive an email to generate the hazard sign for these two rooms
5. ~~get keys for 359
6. ~~practice adding something to the agora
- it would also be good to clarify all of the trainings required for the lab, and the figure out the training matrix and get everyone to fill them out

went to look for room 417 (to autoclave bags for EH&S inspection on 5/10) - was able to enter the room to the left (not the room directly in front of the elevator) BUT there was no door to room 417 (416 - 418, no 417)

reached out to hibah to see if she contacted anyone for the autoclave
- ask sama in the 1-1 if he gave hibah any information on who to contact / who to contact in general (kaplan?)
- hibah is asking sal (who's on the 4th floor often) to see if they know anything
---
lab manual updates *planned, 1st draft*
- added self to mychem - applied for access? ask sama in 1-1 - got it

1. look at mychem for chemical information
2. update 'laboratory hazards' based on mychem information AND laser information
3. update 'safety equipment and PPE' based on mychem and laser information
4. update 'safety procedures and protocols' based on chemicals / laser / update standard operating procedures for chemical handling, biosafety protocols, animal handling protocols, laser safety protocols
5. section 5-10 based on EH&S guidelines

update lab safety matrix in the binder
put the materials actually IN the binder

for maui
- build enclosure for the laser beam before it enters the microscope apparatus
- build better enclosure for the microscope
- build stage for the microscope
	- attached to the board, able to lift and lower, running saline to the fly, running carbogen to oxygenate the saline, running CO2/air to lift the ball for the fly to stand on
- moving old compressed air bottles out
- labeling lab setup
- sama has contact people i can talk to, but i will be engineering and building the set up, which is cool

most expensive pieces - the objective and the two amplifiers on the wide of the scope
### Done
- sent photo to lydia
- Finished drosophila primer
- got MyChem to the lab
- 1-1 with sama, notes made
- journal club
- accessed agora editing on obsidian
- got key to 359
- added rooms to mychem
- emailed tu about procard
- emailed william kaplan about autoclave
- updated agora with my bio

### goals for tomorrow
- Read LSM
- hopefully mychem will be ready for me to make hazard signs for 359 and 365
- hopefully we will be able to autoclave the fly bags to prepare for the safety inspection on the tenth
- finish twist read through
- continue agora read thorugh
- begin editing lab manual
