## To Do
- Continue reading EH&S LSM + note *on pg 133
	- get access to the lab safety dashboard
	- *if i finish reading 1) compile notes into to do lists for binders/lab rooms/manual and 2) begin to implement*

- Safety inspection
	- lydia is printing and posting(?) the new hazcom signs for 359 and 365
	- *didnt happen? maybe?*

- ~~Read through Hibah's chancellorships + get ready to take them over

- Read Twist
- Read Agora
	- take notes on things that would make it easier to use / onboard

- ~~1:30 - lab meeting in 315
- ~~~2:30 - check in with hibah
- ~~3:30 - meeting with Hibah and sama
- ~~pick up fly food w/ hibah
	- *we have enough, so we're not picking up this week, BUT hibah is going to show me where the lab is*

- Label keys

## Notes
continued safety notes - from pg 102

- [autoclave training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM_JTgLSKXk)
- [autoclaving biohazardous waste](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/autoclaving-biohazardous-waste-guidelines-98)
	- follow the guidelines in the attached document AND make a lab specific SOP for the autoclave
- talked to stephanie 
	- wang lab just throws bumblebees away OR freezes and then tosses octopi + crabs
		- they use a regular freezer, just needs to be labeled 'no food'
	- they dont have to label their animals / waste as biohazards, it would be good to ask other drosophila labs

- clothes
	- core body (no crops) and legs covered

- 3 trainings that are required for RP / CHO (cover developing SOPs etc)
	- [laboratory Safety Practices - Zoom](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/laboratory-safety-practices-zoom)
	- [Laboratory Safety Compliance - Online](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/laboratory-safety-compliance-online)
	- [Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) Hands-On Training](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/chemical-hygiene-officer-cho-hands-training)
i think sama, lydia and myself will have to complete these trainings 

required components of an SOP
- process or experiment description
- hazardous chemicals/class of hazardous chemicals
- PPE
- Engineering / Ventilation controls
- Special handling procedures and storage requirements
- spill and accident procedures
- waste disposal
- special procedures with animals (*do we need this?*)
- approval required (like what required trainings are needed)
- decontamination
- designated area
*use this as a framework when making SOPs*

sample sops available online, but MUST be edited to reflect the needs of the lab

STEPS TO DEVELOPING SOPs
1) modify existing SOPs
2) identify requirements
	- by process
	- by individual chemical
	- by class of chemical
3) complete the SOPs
4) file the SOPs (in paper + in the digital lab manual)

when updating SOPs, sign and note the revision date, and then alert all lab members of the revision

### Chancellorships
Hibah is chancellor of : fly food / calendars / purchasing / safety (co-first with lydia)

#### Fly Food
ordering fly food
- [order food](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/how+to+order+fly+food) on Tuesday's from Jay Parrish's lab using a spread sheet linked on the agora
- food is picked up on fridays (after lab meeting) from LSB third floor

capping fly food
- take the bottles to 332 and plug the bottles + vials immediately (so they don't get contaminated)
- use a piece of lab tape + write the date the food was delivered 
	- *on the tray or on each individual vial / bottle?*
- old trays go in 332 and are returned the next time we pick up food

ordering plugs
- when there's on box of plugs left, order more from genesee 
	- *autoclave compatible or not? waiting to see what we land on for that*

#### Calendars
scheduling

room reservation
- [how to book a room on campus](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/how+to+book+a+room+on+campus)
- use guthrie 315 the most, with guthrie 211 as a back up, set up the lab schedule asap to the start of the new quarter

maintain lab calendar
- gathering schedules for everybody + making a lab meeting schedule that works for everyone

group meetings

#### Purchasing
maintain the lab ordering and supplies spread sheet

communicate with tu as needed

use the lab procard 
- *need to get a new procard, sent an email to tu Wed, i'll follow up on 5/15 (Wed) - and if nothing, in person*

responsible for knowing how to get reimbursed for travel / lab expenses
- [travel](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/how+to+get+reimbursed+for+travel)
- [expenses](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/how+to+get+reimbursed+for+lab+expenses)
- avoid needing to be reimbursed as much as possible

#### Safety
read and update SOPs

chemical / biological waster disposal

making sure we pass safety inspections 

updating the lab rooms / lab binders to make sure we are in compliance 

making sure everyone is up to date with safety trainings 

updating the lab manual


### agora updates
- [how to purchase things](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/how+to+purchase+things) still lists ariba as the purchasing software, a new process for purchasing needs to be recorded on the wiki
- (other notes for updates moved to [[OUTDATED agora updates]])

## Done
- notes on hibahs chancellorships
- started [[OUTDATED agora updates]] and [[chancellorships]]
- continued reading UW EH&S LSM and taking notes
- went to saint bread for lab pastries
- had 1:30 lab meeting
- met with Hibah to recap the week
- sent karin a photo for a presentation
- met with sama and hibah to talk about onboarding + autoclave
- went to LSB with hibah to check out the fly kitchen, found fly food, brought back to 332 and plugged
- also hibah is going to send me her contact information <3
