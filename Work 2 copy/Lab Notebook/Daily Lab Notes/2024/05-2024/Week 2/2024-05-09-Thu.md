### Notes
guide for editing lab manual from yesterday : 

lab manual updates *planned, 1st draft*
- added self to mychem - applied for access? ask sama in 1-1 - got it

1. look at mychem for chemical information
2. update 'laboratory hazards' based on mychem information AND laser information
3. update 'safety equipment and PPE' based on mychem and laser information
4. update 'safety procedures and protocols' based on chemicals / laser / update standard operating procedures for chemical handling, biosafety protocols, animal handling protocols, laser safety protocols
5. section 5-10 based on EH&S guidelines

update lab safety matrix in the binder
put the materials actually IN the binder 

---
Safety updates 
- complete SOPs (compressed gas and chemicals and laser *needed in 359 book only* and flies? and safety procedures) and add to 1) physical lab binder 2) digital lab book
#### Required in the lab
- spill kits (need one for 342, 365, 332?)
- lab signage (359 / 365)
	- described in sections 2.a.6 and 4.a of eh&s LSM
	- caution sign for 359 needs to contain laser danger information
	- *usually mychem auto makes these signs, but they havent made the correct ones for 359 / 365 yet, posted in twist about it*
- fire extinguisher in each room? (342 and 359 for sure likely, but 365?)
- first aid kits in each room (332/342/359/365?)

#### Required in the binder
**All binders must include the following**
- CHP *note, the lab specific plan on pg 14 of the EH&s LSM serves as the CHP, so the EH&S LSM serves as the CHP when that section is completed*
	- Regulation WAC 296-828  
		- included in the EH&S LSM as Appendix A
	- lab specific SOPS
		- compressed gas
		- chemicals
		- laser
		- *more?*
	- chemical inventory
- SDSs for chemicals in the space


- general eh&s safety manual
	- check in lab if it includes the lab specific and emergency portion, and update in the eh&s lsm
	- emergency - pg 13
	- lab specific - pg 14
	- lab personnel - pg 16
- completed EH&S lab safety matrices for each lab member - completed and signed
- SDSs for all chemicals in the lab
- **359 - laser safety manual**
- **365 / 342 - biosafety manual** *i am actually not sure about this one, because it seems to pertain to medical / genetics / larger animal work, but we likely will still need one to cover - call ehs about it*
- **359 - laser safety procedure document**
- safe work practices and rules 
	- documented as general lab rules and included with SOPs in binders for EACH lab 
	- include PPE requirements

CHECK may be included as part of eh&s lsm, so these would just need to be updated, not added
- lab specific safety manual 
	- specific structure on pg 14 of the eh&s lsm, serves as the chemical hygiene plan
	- specific requirement checklist included in this *use when updating binder*
- emergency information page
	- pg 13 of eh&s lsm
##### Required in the Lab Specific CHP 
*part of the lab manual, but explicitly pointed out here for clarity*
*quoting from the EH&S LSM*
required in the lab specific CHP
- The safety requirements, either as laboratory rules or standard operating procedures (SOPs), including PPE requirements 
	- SOPs for laser in 359
	- SOPs for bio in 342 + 365
	- SOPs for compressed gas in 342 + 359
	- SOPs for chemicals in 342 *and 365? what work do they perform in there*
	- SOPs for emergency procedures (fire / spill / laser accident)
	- SOPs for fly handling
- Laboratory-specific topics, including hazardous environments, materials and equipment used, covered in the laboratory’s training program  
- Additional details specific to the laboratory and generally described on the laboratory-specific information at the beginning of the LSM 
#### Required in the lab safety manual
- hazard and risk assessment for lab tasks - described below
steps in identifying hazards and and assessing risk *required by EH&S LSM - quoting*
Steps in the assessment include: 
1. Research chemicals and processes to be used. 
2. Identify and evaluate all types of hazards involved. 
	Some evaluations to consider: 
	- what are the hazards? 
	- What is the worst that can happen? 
	- What can be done to prevent that? 
	- What can be done to minimize each risk?
	- What should be done if something goes wrong? 
1. Consider if additional hazards may be present, if scaling up 
2. Select controls to adequately lower the perceived risks, using the hierarchy of controls (starting with the most effective): 
	 - Eliminate hazardous substances and hazardous steps in the process (if possible)
	 - Substitute with less-hazardous chemicals, smaller quantities, and safer processes
	 - Implement engineering controls, such as local ventilation or remote controls
	 - Implement administrative controls, such as an after-hours policy during exceptionally hazardous processes
	 - As a last line of defense, assess PPE requirements 
		 - Refer to our website for additional guidance on general PPE practices. 
			*Additional information on hazard identification can be found in the document: 
				Identifying and Evaluating Hazards in Research Laboratories: Guidelines Developed by the Hazards Identification and Evaluation Task Force of the American Chemical Society’s Committee on Chemical Safety, 2013.
5. Ensure emergency response situations have been addressed:
	Hazards identified and assessment of risk should be documented for any new procedures, practices, or spaces involving usage of hazardous chemicals or materials. A risk assessment tool and guide are available on our website. *If the assessment results in requirements for controls, those requirements must be documented in lab protocols (as described in the following paragraph).* For best practices, it is recommended that the assessment be documented whether or not controls are required.

#### required safety trainings
- Compressed gas 
	- *Who?
- Laser
	- anyone who works with maui
	- the online laser safety training AND hands on laser safety training
- Managing laboratory chemicals
	- *who?
- Fire Extinguisher
	- everyone in the lab *does the lab have a fire extinguisher?*
- *More?*
in general, lab trainings are required for 1) general + lab specific training 2) specific chemical / hazard training 3) PPE training

each lab member needs a completed and signed EH&S lab training matrix (in each binder?)


### annually review and update the following
- UW EH&S LSM - check every DECEMBER for changes
- SOPs - check and review and update if needed
- MyChem inventory and available SDSs - check if current, remove if outdated
- internal inspections
- routine maintenance records - fire extinguisher expiration / safety shower maintenance 
- equipment conditions
- review and update CHP - brief lab if major changes occur

### NOTES
- CHP must be available at all times for personnel working in spaces with hazards 
	- *does this mean we need a binder in 359 as well?* **YES, we need a CHP in each room (must be accessible without needing a key rom someone or leaving the lab space)**
- CHP must be reviewed and updated *annually*
- self inspections must be performed *annually*
- Additional manuals are required
	- Biosafety manual for 342 - 365?
	- laser safety manual for 359
- write SOP for laser alignment (using alignment guidelines) and operation
- RP - responsible party, is the PI in our case
- CHO - chemical hygiene officer, RP by default, but they can delegate it to someone else *i think this is lydia in our lab*
- list of chemicals in mychem must be reviewed *annually*
- self inspections need to be formal, and it would be useful to create a checklist that can be used
	- EH&S prepped checklist available - link on pg 25 EH&S LSM

- may require spill control (place on absorbent pad) for bench top if chemicals on bench top BUT sama wants to transition away from ethanol/apple cider vinegar traps anyways
- label gas lines in the lab - 342 needs labels for the gas coming to the fly plates from the co2 tanks
- all gas canisters need 'in use'/'half full'/'empty' tags
- does the lab produce chemical waste? if so, of what kind?

- is there an eyewash in 342?
- flush eyewash and document flush every week

- fire extinguishers need to be wall mounted
- ABC or BC (less powerful but less cleanup) extinguisher required
- do we need a flammable cabinet? why do we have ethanol, is it just for the traps that the lab is moving away from, or will it be an ongoing material we use and need to deal with storage and disposal of?

- required lab signs
	- lab caution sign
	- emergency procedures
	- lab layout / emergency equipment location signs
	- hazard warning signs
	- natural gas shut off (*only if a valve is present in the lab*)
	- nonpotable, do not drink on lab water
- 342 needs a suite sign, and 342 cold room may need a sign as well
- plexiglass holder required
- emergency response and spill response posters required (342 / 332? / 365? / 359)
- emergency contact numbers required to be posted (PI and lab personnel to be called (so sama lydia and myself))
- lab layout with locations of safety equipment required (342 / 359 / 365? /332?)
- specific laser warning sign required for 359 / possibly need biohazard sign for 342?
	- *i should call eh&s soon/tomorrow to figure out if drosophila research requires a biohazard sign / biosafety lab notebook / dead flies need biohazard bag etc*
- mold in cold rooms focus sheet included in LMS
	- remove cardboard / absorbent materials to get rid of mold
	- check humidity / lower ambient humidity
	- *could help with the troubleshooting*
- this may affect [[Work/Lab Notebook/Hub Notes/Projects/Maui|Maui]] - cannot penetrate ceiling tiles to run piping for compressed gas or liquid through them
- operating manuals with instruments (incubators / fly pads / 3d printer / maui etc)

### autoclave research

Flugs
- Flystuff (cat # 49-100) Bonded Dense Weave Cellulose Acetate
	- given that there is another product that appears to be made of a different material (or at least is a different structure of the same material) and it is labeled as 'autoclaveable' and the flugs we use are not, i am going to assume they are not
	- called genesee - not autoclaveable
Vials
- Flystuff (cat # 32-116SB) polystyrene
	- called genesee - not autoclaveable

Alternatives to autoclaving (ie no/reduced material change)
- freezing the flies (*could we do this in a chest freezer set up in the cold room or use another labs space? - would probably be best to not have to transport the materials / rely on the space of others - how cold does the freezer need to be?)

Alternatives that ARE autoclaveable

Plugs
- Droso-Plugs 
	- Vial size (cat # 59 - 200) genesee - $443.90 for 6760 (7 cents per plug) vs $176.65 for 1000 (18 cents per plug) (current) 
	- Bottle size (cat # 59-194P) genesee - $577.75 for 2560 (22 cents per plug) vs $234.05 for 1000 (23 cents per plug) (current)

Vials
- Glass Drosophila vials (cat # 32-201 / 32-201C) genesee - same size as the current polystyrene vials, but more expensive 
	- $618.34 for 720 vs $153.35 for 1000 (current)
- Polypropylene vials (cat # 32-120) genesee - same size as the current vials AND fully autoclaveable (according to genesee flystuff catalog) (autoclave settings - 121 C 15 psi 15 minutes) 
	- $73.95 for 500 (ie $148 for 1000) compared to $153 for 1000 (current)

Bottles
- polypropylene bottles (cat # 32-129F) genesee - 8 oz round bottom
	- $124.98 for 250
- polypropylene bottles (cat # 32-130) genesee - 6 oz square bottom
	- $155.50 for 500

autoclaveable = reusable, so would we want to reuse these (ie autoclave, then empty, then toss and reuse). or would that be too much work?

**note - genesee also does food testing, maybe use if other methods of mold troubleshooting don't work? could be useful if problems are persistent**

### Done
- reading and notes on LSM began
- hibah and i checked autocalve + working on fly disposal (current plan is to freeze this round of flies and then properly prep the following to autoclave - autoclave safe bags and maybe containers?)
- lydia made new hazcom signs and is printing them, not sure if she or i are going to post them though
- researched if flugs and vials can be autoclaved
	- found alternative materials + compiled list w/ costs included
- made [[Dead Fly disposal]] and [[Work/Lab Notebook/Hub Notes/Projects/Maui|Maui]] and [[LSM Notes]] notes to keep track of progress with those projects
- went to fly club
