### Notes

#### Reconciliations and Purchasing
- No new procard yet, if something needs to be purchased, pass the link to Tu until a new procard is gained
- Hibah is posting a video tutorial on handling this, which will be very helpful

'Verify Procurement card transactions'
- add orders to the 'order and supplies' list ASAP 
- handle verifications ASAP (once order is received take care of, so they dont stack up and overwhelm)
- keep all packing slips (save email notifications AND take photos of the physical slip and save somewhere *make a paper trail on purpose*)
- handle verifications one at a time (do NOT select all)
- upload packing slip image at the bottom of the verification screen
- select 'sales tax whatever' button for most vendors (indicates sales tax already taken out, if confused if a vendor has taken sales tax or not, talk to Tu)
	- if no tax at purchase select 'default tax option' and 'seattle sales tax'
- line item description 'lab supplies'
- spend category 'lab supplies'
- add quantity
- **Double check with sama for grant selection**
	- most new purchases should be burroughs grant, not start up, but reach out to verify
- Program ID - PG122974
- Resource - RS100001
- additional work tags - auto populate BUT add 'Ahmed, sama'

Draft verifications live in the 'Find procurement card transaction verifications'
- cant see what the purchase / vendor is from this screen 

yellow question mark appear?
- talk to / message Tu to see what's up 
- *rare, usually with vendors that haven't taken sales tax*

#### Fly order form
- fly food! 
- **order on tuesday mornings, pick up on fridays post lab meetings**
	- one tray of vials, one tray of bottles
- get the vials and trays from (*get clarification from hibah, go with her this friday*)
- get bottles and **PLUG IMMEDIATELY**
	- plugs in 332, plug and put in the cold room
- WATCH bottles for mold (*long term project to troubleshoot this*)
- communication with the fly kitchen can be weird, maybe another long term project to help streamline this?
