## Moldy Food
Tossed Moldy food today. we had two trays, both from 5/3. In one tray, almost all of the vials contained mold while in the other tray very few vials contained mold.

The first tray will be called the 'mold' tray and the second will be the 'clean' tray

the mold in each tray also looked different
the mold tray vials had many small white dots of mold, the clean tray vials usually had one large mold spot in the center of the vial

I have replaced the majority of the vials back into the clean tray, and tied the bag to close it, this is how the bag was stored prior to me opening it and checking the vials
I took 6 vials (unsure if they were originally from the mold tray or the clean tray) and placed them in the mold tray, three in the back and three in the front

differences between the trays

mold tray
- older/more used cardboard
- older / discolored (brown) cheese cloth
- the outer plastic bag was open and had a small tear

clean tray
- newer / less used looking cardboard
- white cheesecloth
- the outer plastic was closed (did not check for tears)

i placed the 6 vials into the mold tray, and left it as i found it

i also accidentally opened a vial (removed the flug) while looking through them, i have labeled this vial 'do not use' and placed it on the top shelf, to see if opening the container in the cold room would cause any mold growth
- *this could be a useful thing to do later on, maybe leave some vials open for various periods of time (1 minute, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 12 hours) and see if any of those grow mold (along with an unopened control from the same batch) to see if any of them grow mold - in theory any spores in the cold room itself would grow in the vials, with the vials that are open longer growing more mold or growing mold sooner - read on this*

this is a very informal little afterthought test, but it could be useful in guiding us on mold prevention in the future
