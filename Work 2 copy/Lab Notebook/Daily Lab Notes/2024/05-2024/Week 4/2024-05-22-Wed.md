# notes

## Purchases
Talked to Tu!
reply to the email he sent me with packing slips or notes - no packing slip
he will handle reconciliations on his end, all i have to do is send packing slips

he forwarded me a list of items to add to the sheet + to confirm receipt of

so! add all of these items to the 2024 sheet and NOTE the ones that have arrived with the DATE

aliexpress links blocked - use the lab machine to bypass proofpoint and get product details
- *Solved! delete the URL defense section of the link and visit as usual - checked on virus total before doing this, the link was marked clean by all but 1 vendor, and since im only using the link to look at items + prices, i feel okay using it*
