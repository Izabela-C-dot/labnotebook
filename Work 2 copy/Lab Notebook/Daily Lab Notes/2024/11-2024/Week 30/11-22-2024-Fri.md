## laser hazard walkthrough deliverables
THINGS AMY WANTS
- interlock system on the laser enclosure - doors open the shutter automatically closes
	- sama says charles would be the person to ask about this
	- possible alternative - we physically lock the doors to the laser enclosure to prevent accidental openings
- light tight laser enclosure
- send amy the LSP
	- she will help me update it
	- she will help me write the alignment guide
- laser in use sign - switch the front sign piece to red in place of green
- what wavelength do we use?
	- alignment -
	- operation - 920 nm
- replace the purple goggles 
	- check the operating wavelength and make sure the goggles suit the wavelength
- signage on the hallway doors - for emergency personnel to know the center rooms are occupied
	- building coordinator contact about this

- ~~email amy
	- send LSP
	- send operating wavelength
	- ask if external locks on the laser chamber doors would be sufficient to replace an automatic interlock system?
	- interlock on the external doors?
## stst
- meeting with lydia
	- its the time to brute force this 
	- both rigs
	- amplify bottles 
		- 4 of each ready to collect
			- *changed to 3 of w1118 and canton s and 2 of the other bottles - reason? the other genotype bottles have been fruitful now that lydia is collecting more regularly so 4 total seems like overkill - balance producing animals to use and cutting down on waste*
	- unlabeled box on the top shelf?
	- collecting virgins
		- when are you collecting virgins?
			- shes on a schedule now and that seems to be solving the production issues 
		- *observe collection* - she seems to be doing a lot better now that she has a schedule
	- the flies on moldy food - flies should never be on moldy food
## mateo
- fly work onboarding 
	- fly pushing
	- fly sexing
	- fly husbandry + amplification
	- UAS-Gal4 system
- *make a list on what i know - what to send him - what to teach him*
## AFTER DEC 1
- meet with mary to talk about assisting with the hotcell project
	- bring up ideas in [[post 10.23.2024]]
## enki
- write an agora for enki *do this after princess is able to use him in a functional capacity*
	- how to build 
		- parts list
		- length of all tubes used
		- STL file for needle holder and sample holder?
	- how to use
	- how to maintain
	- troubleshooting
	- draw a schematic
## C priorities 
### agora additions
- write an agora - dictionary of all the short hand phrases on our fly stocks
- how to add flies to the stock list
	- translate fly stock notes
- how to add new people to maui?
	- PERSON
		- safety trainings
			- fire extinguisher
			- lab chemicals
			- compressed gas
			- laser worker safety
	- BINDER
		- add a new safety training matrix sheet
		- add a new safety training record sheet
		- add a new name + contact information to pg 16 of the LSM (personnel list)
### personal organization
- add og fly notes to obsidian
- add stock add notes to obsidian
- add balancer notes to obsidian
- add recombination notes to obsidian
- start document of questions and answers for the fly gene stuff
### safety
- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30
- safety binder assemble 365/332/342
- go through and address the notes in 2/16/2024 safety report on the lab safety dashboard
	- check that all feasible notes have been addressed
- update lab safety dashboard
### etc + long term projects
- sigmacote and jerseycote
	- work with EHS to determine how to get rid of the sigmacote ONCE I RECEIVE THE JERSEYCOTE, preferably by exchanging it / giving it to another lab on campus
- set up binder for packing slips

# notes
## PRIORITIES
- meeting with lydia
	- setting up new bottles 
	- making a schedule and plan
- picking up and capping fly food
- sending amy the lsp + questions
- contacting darwin + scheduling maintenance
## laser interlock
- preferred if its on the chamber doors and not the external door, but external door may be the easiest to install
	- what if we have a laser interlock system that can be overridden if someone in the room needs to leave the room? (how do they get back inside?)
		- keypad outside the door to override - 
		- inside override?
- cost?
- *return to this later - talk with princess / other 2p labs / charles*
