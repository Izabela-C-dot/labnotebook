I am sorry to hear about the issues you are experiencing with your Darwin chambers. What set points are you running on these chambers? Also, is the water sitting in the tube connected to the humidifier tank on top of the chamber? There may be some built up water inside of the drain pan behind the fans as well but, we can check some other things first.
