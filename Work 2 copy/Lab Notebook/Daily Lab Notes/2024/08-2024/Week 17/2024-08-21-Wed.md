# notes
## Continuing with Dropbox
- going to make a selection of test notes to see if any show up
	- TEST 1 - in 'atoms' - the dropbox folder that indicates its shared (images of people on the folder) but has no data in it
	- TEST 2 - in 'agora 2' - the dropbox folder that does not indicate it is shared, but has data and the correct formatting
	- TEST 3 - dragged manually from my obsidian to the dropbox in browser
- and we'll see what happens, ask sama which shows up

## 1-1 notes, fast
- dropbox help to figure this out - talk to lydia and reach out to DB itself
- talking about balancers, balancer hw

balancers
1) prevent recombination 
2) homozygous lethal
3) naked eye phenotypic markers

male flies do not recombine IMPORTANT
