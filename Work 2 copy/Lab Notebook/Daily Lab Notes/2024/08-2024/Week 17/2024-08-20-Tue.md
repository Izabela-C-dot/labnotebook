### etc + long term projects
- sigmacote and jerseycote

	- using the connectors that we ordered for enki
- continue fly stocks
- binder for packing slips
 
# notes
## dropbox
OKAY
- i have tried connecting to the agora folder that says its connected (but its format is incorrect compared to the agora i was adding to before)
- i have tried writing in agora 2 and then dragging the markdown file to agora 1 ('atoms')
- i have tried uploading the markdown files directly to dropbox in the browser\

- asked sal - they suggested i reach out to lydia, who also uses a mac, to see how she adds to the agora - reached out to princess as well if either of them have ever had issues adding to the agora on their macs

OKAY
one of two things worked 
- manually moving the file to the dropbox in the browser
- making the note in the weird blank agora 1 ('atoms')
this is not ideal, but it does work - still want to work with princess and lydia to find an easier way to do this (would be really tedious if i go through and do a bunch of edits)
