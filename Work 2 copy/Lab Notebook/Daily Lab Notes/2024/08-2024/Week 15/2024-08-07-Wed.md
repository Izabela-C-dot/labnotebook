## personal space
- ~~assays
	- ~~9
	- ~~1

- ~~collect
	- ~~early
	- ~~late (3ish)

## enki
- ~~build shelf~~ *need rubber mallet, order sent to tu
## etc
- ~~check on old items
- ~~switch CO2 tank
	- want someone whos done it before there when i switch, asked kyle, sal suggested i ask victoria or rich
	- *kyle can do this with me, likely on friday*
## C priorities 

### personal space
- add to paper bones
### purchasing
- continue consumables check
- add consumables to list (autoclave bags / thin sharpies)
### agora additions
- write an agora page on how to order flies from bloomington 
	- make a note somewhere for yourself - when someone orders, ping the whole lab to add things to that order if they want anything
	- ordering flies includes quarantining them, include instructions for that on this page
	- *write agora on buying + quarantining flies once completed*

- write an agora on how to cite BL flies
- write an agora on how to add flies to the stock list

- write an agora - dictionary of all the short hand phrases on our fly stocks

- write an agora on how to order fly food
- write agora on autoclaving flies

- write an agora / legacy document about cleaning the lab spaces (cleaned up version of the checklist, with images maybe?)
### personal organization
- add og fly notes to obsidian
- add stock add notes to obsidian
- start document of questions and answers for the fly gene stuff
### safety
- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30
- print out updated lab signs
- *continue to cut this into small pieces to work on in the background*
- laser signage

### etc + long term projects
- sigmacote and jerseycote
	- follow link lydia sent for jersey - talk to the company and see about the high hazardous materials fee for a non hazardous chemical
	- work with EHS to determine how to get rid of the sigmacote, preferably by exchanging it / giving it to another lab on campus
- Attach co2 tubing to the wall in 342
	- using the connectors that will be ordered for enki
- continue fly stocks
### maui

# notes
## personal space
7.29 flies have started eclosing
flip ps bottles friday and monday this week, to get a lot of flies started for karin
## shelf
need a rubber mallet - added to this weeks order
now it is open under the table in 342 until I can get the mallet needed to assemble it
## 10:29
- ~~check eclosing flies
	- ~~collect if eclosing
- ~~check on old items
- 12 - set up 9 assay
- build shelf (build in 342 and move to 359?)
- c priorities

## 12:06
- ~~set up 9 assay
- ~~pick up packages
- process packages
- *switch out co2 tank* (ACTUALLY i would really rather have someone whos done it before be with me when i switch for the first time - watch someone do it, then they watch you do it, and then you can do it solo - its not cowardice its wanting to be cautious around an important and dangerous piece of equipment)

## 13:28
- ~~set up 1 assay
- ~~complete package processing
- ~~late collection
## co2 tank
- kyle HAS done it before, but is at the neuroai conference today and tomorrow, so i asked princess and mary to use the single microscope for right now, so the tank will still have some pressure in it when i take it down to the loading dock
- weird - both tanks seem super low? no one told me the single tank was low, and i dont know how often the lab goes through tanks. will order two once the regulator is put on the double microscope tubing
- or is this normal? the level on the 'direct from tank' dial is low, but its still flowing? switch the double scope one but don't take it down, ask sama 
okay ! this is settled, regulator switched and will be switched on the solo scope tank when a new tank arrives
# done
- early collection
- pc58
- checked on old items
- pc59
- figured out when to switch regulator on co2 with kyle
- packages
- late collection
- switched regulator with kyle
# to do tomorrow
- printing figure out
- atr food
- packages
- trash in the corridor

tanks
- take empty and closed tank to loading bay
- order 2 co2 tanks
	- bring new one upstairs, replace solo scope regulator
	- take old solo scope tank to loading bay
	- bring second full tank up for the back up tank
