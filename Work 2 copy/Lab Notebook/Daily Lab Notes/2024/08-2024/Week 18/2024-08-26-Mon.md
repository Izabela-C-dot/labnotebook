## quality checking
- reached out to karin - look over some of the pcs i qced to see if she gets the same number of flies with damage as i did, so we can make sure we're judging them using the same standard
## quarantine flies
- all f1 vials progressing well, one of princesses vials (94620) is ready to be flipped to f2 - instead of doing an awake flip, im going to ice anesthetize and then tip some of the f1 flies into a new vial (a lot of f1 flies rn, and I dont want to overcrowd the f2 vial)
- success, left a good amount of f1 flies in the vial in case i need a new f2
