# notes
## fly food
- i was considering not ordering any fly food today, but I think sticking with the current plan is the best choice - having more than we need is better than not having enough, and I think if some ends up going bad, its not the worst loss. Also lydia is experimenting now, princesses new bdsc stocks are coming in soon, the current quarantined flies are aging and about ready to be used, id rather have more than we need than not enough
- this week i should return some trays and boxes - toss bags

## do after lunch
- ~~finish autoclave process
- update slides
- ~~microscope quotes
- ~~late collection

## new microscope
- leica M80
	- whats the lighting configuration of the microscopes in 342?
	- whats the stand of the microscopes in 342?
- it looks like the 342 microscope base is an ergotube (according to the leica website)
- 342 microscope lighting : LED3000 RL

- found 2 scopes on fisher scientific, but the lighting is wrong on one and the other is $5000 more because of an integrated camera
	- could i buy the one with the 'wrong' lighting and then just get a lighting rig for it?
(add this to my 1-1 slides)

## chatting with sama
- new microscope low priority

- new ethanol bottle in 332 (spray area around q tray)
- quarantine tray
- toss 00 and g0 flies
	- add to bdsc protocol - once the next gen of flies are established in a vial, toss the old (in a trashcan specifically for flies in 332)
		- buy a trashcan for 332 for flies to autoclave
- work on 'onboarding undergrads' agora - onboarding sahana, but get this agora ready for that
