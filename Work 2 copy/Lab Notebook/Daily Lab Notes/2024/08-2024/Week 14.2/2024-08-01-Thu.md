## incubators
go into 342 and look if the envelope on top of the incubators has directions for them
try and go from there, if no directions, call the number on the incubator
check the agora 

add to 'timeline of issues on the agora'
- started july 22nd
- happened again/noticed again august 1st

OKAY by hitting the 'manual' button you change it from on to auto to off
i think auto is the setting where the timer is used, so I will check that tomorrow morning - both incubators have been set to auto, and I will check that both of them are working correctly before proceeding ( i dont know if they are busted or were just on the wrong setting, so i will check tomorrow so i have a reason to call darwin if they arent working right (essentially restart my computer BEFORE going to IT so we dont have to do that together))

## 15:44
- ~~talk to someone about the tanks
	- praxair - go from there
- late collection

## gas tanks
- emailed william about them - i am not sure what to do with them and i am not sure that praxair will take them if they are not empty
