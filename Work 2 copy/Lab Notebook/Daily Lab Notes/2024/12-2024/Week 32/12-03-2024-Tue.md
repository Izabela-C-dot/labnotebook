# notes

	- *why not 12?* - not enough flies in the right age
- only up to zh21 in the ahmed lab server
	- QCing data - taking a long time 
	- asked lydia if i need to keep watching after the first copulation
		- can't play faster with VLC and the Qmedia player doesn't have the correct time stamps (shows an hour 30 in stead of thirty minutes) - so do i need to just watch the videos all the way?

## incubators
