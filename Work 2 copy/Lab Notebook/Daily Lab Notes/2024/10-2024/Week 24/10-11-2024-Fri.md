# to do
## personal space
- ~~early collection
- ~~early clear
- ~~early testing
	- ~~pc135
	- ~~pc136
- ~~flips
	- PS
- ~~late collection
	- UAS-Chr
	- PS
## today
- ~~move to the corner office
## etc
- ~~packages

- move empty tank downstairs
- skim NAPE papers
- finish adding fly stocks
- call darwin chambers

- WHEN the fly trash is full TAKE A PICTURE and add to the agora
## enki
- write an agora for enki
	- how to build 
	- how to maintain
	- draw a schematic
	- lengths of the tubes *do when we have a solid rig*

- design work on V2
- print V2
## maui
- find the hard drive space of the maui computer

- MAUI safety binder *look into safety project notes for this*
	- what needs to be in there *check amy email*
		- Emergency information
		- CHP lab specific
		- laser safety procedure - written by PI and safety officer - template online
		- safety matrix for each worker
		- safety training records for each worker
		- lab floor plan
		- self inspection records
		- lab safety manual
	- what do we need to do to get the laser certified?
		- wait for completed installation and then contact amy (<[amylhlim@uw.edu]>) and set up an inspection / hazard assessment 
			- fully enclose the laser path
			- complete the safety binder
	- **complete laser registration**
## agoras
- how to add flies to the stock list
	- translate fly stock notes
- autoclave 
	- how to use it - attach to the chancellor of the main lab space agora page
- add trash information on main lab chancellorship agora
## C priorities 
### agora additions
- write an agora on how to add flies to the stock list
- write an agora - dictionary of all the short hand phrases on our fly stocks
### personal organization
- add og fly notes to obsidian
- add stock add notes to obsidian
- add balancer notes to obsidian
- add recombination notes to obsidian
- start document of questions and answers for the fly gene stuff
### safety
- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30
- safety binder assemble 365/332/342
### etc + long term projects
- sigmacote and jerseycote
	- work with EHS to determine how to get rid of the sigmacote ONCE I RECEIVE THE JERSEYCOTE, preferably by exchanging it / giving it to another lab on campus
- set up binder for packing slips
- water filled fly plate - fix or replace? (or wait because we only have 2 stations rn)

# notes
## order
- ~~early testing set up
- ~~early collection + flips~~
## changes for version 2 of the needle lifts
big things to consider
1) balancing flow rate
2) positioning the needles
	1) being able to CONSISTENTLY position the needles if they need to be moved for samples to be replaced
the goal is to make a system where you never need to mess with the flow rate of the system or change needle positions - you just need to add water + turn it on

THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED
- the flow needs to be consistent on both sides
- the needle placement needs to be consistent and repeatable
- the water bubble shouldnt vibrate or rise and fall based on water hitting it or it draining too quickly
- the needles need to be able to be moved so samples can be moved BUT ALSO be able to easily be placed back in the same position

IDEAS FOR VERSION 2
- make the lifts taller - so the needles sit lower in the bubble (increase the y angle)
	- no vibration and no sucking
	- *28 to 35*
		- *had to adjust the cut triangle from 18 to 25 to keep the 10 height consistent*
- make the lift base shorter - so only the needles fit and not the leur lock base on the needle
	- will allow for better more consistent positioning - can use the base of the needle as a guide for positioning the needle (ie we know its correct because the base is hitting the sample holder)
	- MEASURE the length of the needle and tailor the lift to that value
	- *55 to 30 - arbitrary*
	- needles are 3.5 cm long (35mm)
	- **FOR THIS ONE - I NEED TO CHANGE THE PLANE OF THE CUT SO IT CAN SUPPORT THE NEEDLE**
- make the lifts hit the sample at a more obtuse angle - so theyre more in line with the sample + farther from the objective (decrease the x angle of the needle)
	- *55 to 30 - arbitrary*
- add guide holes for the needle on the support - secure the needles in a set position BUT they can be slid back and forth as needed for loading new samples 
	- combine with using the back of the needle as a stop guide
- add stops to the base so the sample sits flush with them with the magnet - so the sample sits in the same place every time
	- measure the fly holder and see where the stops need to sit
# done
- early testing
	- pc135
	- pc136
- early collection
- flips
- worked on V2 needle plate
- moved to the corner office
- processed jerseycote
- late collection
# to do monday
- figure out the sigma cote - jersey cote situation
	- how to introduce it to lab members
	- how to use it 
	- to try it before we get rid of the sigmacote
	- to make sure the label is correct
- check for new co2 tank
	- if there? enlist someone, take old tank down and bring new tank up in the same trip
- etc work
	- skim NAPE papers
	- finish adding fly stocks
	- call darwin chambers
	- check space on maui computers (based on purchase list)\
		- its 1 TB
