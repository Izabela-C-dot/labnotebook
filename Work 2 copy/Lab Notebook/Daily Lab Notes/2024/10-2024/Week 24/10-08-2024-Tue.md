- ~~count atr tubes
- ~~order objects - NO BUBBLERS
- quality checks
- move tank downstairs
- NAPE paper skims

- ~~if needle holder finishes printing correctly? test its set up with the sample holder pillar + try attaching needles

## 14:30
- ~~quality checks
- NAPE paper skims
- ~~needle holder V2
- late collection
## needle holder V1
- it fits the sample plate well! the hole is placed correctly and it is in the right proportions

- the magnet holes are a hair too short and too narrow to fit well
- the bottom is printed strangely (striping?) so there may be a slight bend
- the needle lifts could be angled in towards the sample more (ie the bottom corner angle is smaller so the hypotenuse is angled more towards the centerline)

SO i could try with princess attaching needles tomorrow + maybe actually testing flow, and also design v2
