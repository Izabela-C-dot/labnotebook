# to do
## weeklys
- ~~flush eyewash
- ~~make slides
- ~~order fly food
- ~~order objects
	- add command metal hooks + metal clips to the order list for marys poster
## personal space
- ~~late collection
## enki
- ~~playing with 3d modeling - access the current sample holder from P's dropbox
	- new idea! the baseplate lifts, draw + model

- write an agora for enki
	- how to build 
	- how to maintain
	- draw a schematic
	- lengths of the tubes *do when we have a solid rig*

- MAUI safety binder *look into safety project notes for this*
	- what needs to be in there
		- laser safety procedure - written by PI and safety officer - template online
		- what class is our laser?
			- CLASS 4 !! 
		- training certificates for workers
		- laser safety manual
		- lab safety manual
	- what do we need to do to get the laser certified?
		- check through emails
		- wait for completed installation and then contact amy (<[amylhlim@uw.edu]>) and set up an inspection / hazard assessment 
			- fully enclose the laser path
			- complete the safety binder
		- then she'll help us get registered, proper signage (if we need new signage), and then we'll be good to go
## agoras

# notes

## maui binder pages to check
[[Lab Safety Manual Status]]
[[LSM Notes]]
[[Room Status]]
[[maui safety binder]]

from emails between lydia and amy about laser certification
- laser needs to be properly registered
- amy needs to come in and do a hazard assessment
- **laser safety procedure sheet**

heard back from amy yesterday - she said all of the things i have planned for the binder sound good AND i dont need to print the laser safety manual, or SOPS, or MyChem and SDS info, i have updated [[maui safety binder]] accordingly and it feels much more manageable now
