# notes
## post maui meeting notes\
the computer is set up, it just needs an ethernet cable
- doug - in the basement - runs the psych server - likely has one

new idea for the needle rig!
- instead of extending the rim of the sample holder top in a conical fashion, we want to attach the needles to the baseplate of the sample holder (the one that does not move AT ALL) 
	- widen the baseplate, add gently sloping triangles and one hole to guide the needles and support their weight
	- add divots near the inside of the rig to guide the needle tips (two points to guide the needles, but no need to make a channel through anything)

something with the two computers - synchronizing the video data and the image data
- not an uncommon problem in 2 photon imaging
- charles is a good person to ask about this

getting the laser safety certified
- the laser shielding needs to be completed
- a safety binder needs to be established 
	- look at previous notes for what needs to be in the binder

preliminary needle rig today!
