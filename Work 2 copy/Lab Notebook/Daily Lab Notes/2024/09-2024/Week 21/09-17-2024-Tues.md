	- https://www.amazon.com/BBJ-Absorbent-Cotton-Foral-Replacement-11-8118/dp/B089QTFGYD
	- floral wrap! cotton absorbent, will attach it with tape, good and cheap for a basic, can get something more expensive when we have a solidified design

table wrap

- what is the area of the table? (specifically, the space under the enclosure + some 'seam allowance' for folding etc) 
	- 40 by 47 raw - 50 by 50 purchase
	- 2500 square - buying 17.7 x 197 (3486.9 - enough to make some mistakes)
