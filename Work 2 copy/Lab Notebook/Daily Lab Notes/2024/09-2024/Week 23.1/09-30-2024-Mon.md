## enki
- playing with 3d modeling - access the current sample holder from P's dropbox
	- new idea! the baseplate lifts, draw + model

- write an agora for enki
	- how to build 
	- how to maintain
	- draw a schematic
	- lengths of the tubes *do when we have a solid rig*

- MAUI safety binder *look into safety project notes for this*
	- what needs to be in there
		- laser safety procedure - written by PI and safety officer - template online
		- what class is our laser?
			- CLASS 4 !! 
		- training certificates for workers
		- laser safety manual
		- lab safety manual
	- what do we need to do to get the laser certified?
		- check through emails
		- wait for completed installation and then contact amy (<[amylhlim@uw.edu]>) and set up an inspection / hazard assessment 
			- fully enclose the laser path
			- complete the safety binder
		- then she'll help us get registered, proper signage (if we need new signage), and then we'll be good to go
