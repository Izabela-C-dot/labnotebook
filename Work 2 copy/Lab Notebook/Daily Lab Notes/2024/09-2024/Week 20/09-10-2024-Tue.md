# notes
## tube time!
- enki version 1 started, got water to flow
- need a secondary container for the saline + for water that will be up there (see if i can fit two rectangle profile flasks / triangle profile flasks in the currently owned bucket so i can order a second)

- princess and i going to redesign the current holder with needle holes, eliminate the need for secondary supports for the needles (maybe i should practice some 3d modeling today)
- feeling really good

- after done with v1! 
	- photos 
	- drawn schematics 
	- measuring the lengths of tubes connecting all the pieces
	- making a note of what purchased things were actually used in the design
