things for enki!
- clear protective film / protective film on the metal table surface to prevent salt build up and corrosion
- absorbent tube wrap for the outlet tubes - fail safe measure

- clean cables! bundle and organize cables for easier use + better qol
- idea from sama - integrate magnets into the fly holder, so if the objective pushes down on it accidentally, the sample will pop, not the objective
