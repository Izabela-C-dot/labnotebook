# notes
## compressed gas
- emailed praxair (williams suggestion) about the incorrect gas tank being delivered (cdm50 instead of cd50, cga compatible, but the cdm50 is medical gas and not industrial gas, and i think consistency is important - even though i can use the delivered tank, i didnt order it, and i want the one i ordered) and the improperly delivered tank (free standing, next to elevator)
- emailed william about the 359 tanks 
	- he said david would get to the last week, and they are still in 359, and i have the tank that is meant to go in 359 with nowhere to store it (AND ITS FREESTANDING IN THE LOADING BAY) 
		- WHICH i ordered the carbogen in the first place because william told me that the tanks would get moved and I would have a place to put it!
