- personal space
- Enki details + wraps
- Maui safety binder

# to do

## personal space
- ~~early collection
	- PS
- ~~late collection~~ *no late collection today, all bottles cleared*
	- PS
- ~~collect and cap fly food
## etc
- ~~autoclave
- ~~plastic sheets for labels in 342
- ~~two fly traps
## enki
- playing with 3d modeling - access the current sample holder from P's dropbox
	- new idea! the baseplate lifts, draw + model
- ~~measure the OD of all tubing + label~~ *no lengths yet, will wait until we have a solodified rig to do this*
	- (will do lengths eventually, but once the system is more completed)

- ~~source all tubing and update parts list
	- measure od and id of the vacc to flask

- table wrap
- tube wrap

- write an agora for enki
	- how to build 
	- how to maintain
	- draw a schematic

- MAUI safety binder *look into safety project notes for this*
	- what needs to be in there
		- laser safety procedure - written by PI and safety officer - template online
		- what class is our laser?
		- training certificates for workers
		- laser safety manual
		- lab safety manual
	- what do we need to do to get the laser certified
## agoras
- how to add flies to the stock list
	- translate fly stock notes

## C priorities 
### personal space
- add to paper bones
### agora additions
- write an agora on how to add flies to the stock list
- write an agora - dictionary of all the short hand phrases on our fly stocks
### personal organization
- add og fly notes to obsidian
- add stock add notes to obsidian
- add balancer notes to obsidian
- add recombination notes to obsidian
- start document of questions and answers for the fly gene stuff
### safety
- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30
- safety binder assemble? (not a super high priority honestly)
### etc + long term projects
- sigmacote and jerseycote
	- follow link lydia sent for jersey - talk to the company and see about the high hazardous materials fee for a non hazardous chemical
	- work with EHS to determine how to get rid of the sigmacote, preferably by exchanging it / giving it to another lab on campus
- set up binder for packing slips
# notes
## 11:02
- ~~br
- ~~eat
- ~~plastic sheet for labels
- ~~fly traps
- ~~autoclave
- ~~pick up and cap fly food~~
~~lunch
- enki time!
- ~~late collection

## 3d modeling
- imported the fly holder from princesses dropbox and im having a really hard time trying to measure the holder
- so i think i will make a holder with an approximation + go from there?
- and get actual dimensions later?
# done
- early collection done
- started 3d printing tube covers
- made plastic sheet for labels + filled
- made fly traps
- started autoclave
- picked up and capped food
- added all enki parts to the rig list
- labeled all tubing in the rig list 
	- NO LENGTHS YET
- working on 3d modeling
# to do tomorrow
- enki work 
	- modeling
	- table wrap
	- tube wrap
