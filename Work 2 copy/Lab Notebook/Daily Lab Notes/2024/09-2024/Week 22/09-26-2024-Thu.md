## jersey cote
- jersey cote is still flammable, but does it need to be refrigerated?
	- sigmacote specifies a temp, jersey cote says cool and well ventilated so i ASSUME it does not need to be refrigerated, because other wise it would specify that
- message sent to sama
I have finally been able to receive a copy of the jersey-cote SDS, and while it is still flammable, the SDS does not indicate that it needs to be refrigerated.

The SDS for sigmacote specifies a storage temp of 2-8 C, jerseycote only says to store it somewhere ‘cool and well ventilated’.

I have attached both SDS’ to this thread post.

My plan is to order the jersey cote from fisher sci, store it in our flammable cabinet, and arrange for either a chemical pick up or chemical exchange with EH&S - how does this sound to you?

- hooray! hopefully this can be figured and completed soon, so we no longer have something flammable in that fridge + the extra charge for non dangerous chemical thing never came up because jersey cote IS dangerous, its just not as toxic + doesnt need to be kept cold
# done
- called about jersey-cote again
- responded to the NAPE center
- wrapped enki tubes 
- wrapped enki table - not under the plate yet
- took autoclave out to the trash
- working on maui binder
# to do tomorrow
