## mateo notes
post meeting
- he definitely has a lot of character - i think he is a bold / personable person (starting questions, asking about things note related to research / the position) 
- he seems driven, excited for two photon work 
- i asked about collaboration, he has some light, unofficial 'helping out around the lab' type, not not a lot of formal research collaboration on larger projects
- 'laid back' mentorship style, learning by doing - how would he respond to someone getting something wrong or not understanding? - 

post seminar
- presentation skills were average - interesting connections to other peoples work in the lab

## jersey cote
- unable to obtain an SDS on wither supplier website, emailed Lab Scientific to try and obtain that SDS. it says 'non toxic' but the concern is the flammability - thats the reason why we need to have a fire proof fridge, which is expensive and wasteful - if jersey-cote is also flammable, what would be the point in replacing it?
