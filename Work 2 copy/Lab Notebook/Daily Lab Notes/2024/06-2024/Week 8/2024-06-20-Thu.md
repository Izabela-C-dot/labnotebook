# notes
## bloomington acct
- shipping address - 3921 west stevens way NE, seattle wa 98185 
	- pulled from workday 'ship-to' address
	- it is also guthrie hall according to google maps, so i think we're good there
- acct request sent
- APSingle acct does not produce invoices, but receipts of payment + quotes (sama said tu suggested this, the acct type that makes invoices seems much more difficult to use, so i am going to assume they mentioned no invoices for this acct type - if it turns out we need invoices, ill talk with tu and change the acct type with bloomington)
- **acct request sent! now just waiting**

## 12:39
~~check the g on the amount of atr in the freezer~~

~~make new yeast traps~~
~~process packages~~
take the fly bag upstairs to autoclave *postponed to tomorrow*
