# focus for this week
- personal space project - flipping the crosses and possibly collecting virgins to begin to age
- safety - document preparation, hopefully receiving spill kit supplies + assembling, cutting this larger project into smaller manageable pieces
# to do 
## personal space
- ~~flip crosses (keep pip10 and ppk separated)
- *learn more about balancers - video - maybe find some more basic fly resources*

## etc
- co2 tanks *in progress*
	- reach out to EH&S
	- reach out to supplier
- ~~write requisition protocol
	- sal sent me theirs, i may screenshot and upload it to my obsidian
- ~~2:30 sal introduce me to rich

- ~~pick up and process packages

- copy co2 notes into obsidian
- copy new ps protocol details into obsidian

- ~~update mary and karin on flipping schedule ~~
- ~~read hibah co2 message and process
	- need to move the canister to the basement using a special cart downstairs

- ~~set up new order sheet for this week - add batteries and co2 (see if we can rent canister but buy gas) and lab pants to it
	- in progress with gas, need to talk to tu

- set up new crosses for mary and karin (1 more bottle for mary, 2-4 more bottles for karin)

- put g0 farm bottle flipping in calendar (determine when to flip based on old bottles)
- put stock flipping on calendar (tomorrow, and every 3 weeks)

yes theres a lot here - but you dont have to rush and do it all at once or even all today - might be better to set up crosses tomorrow, when you can ask sama where the w1118 flies are
## purchasing and consumables
- make a presentation to introduce the lab to both new systems
	- it should also serve as more in depth instructions on their use
- continue initial check
- add items to the list (autoclave bags?)

## safety
- cut the project into pieces and begin to complete
	- pick a place to start and go
- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30

- Start with printing the signs needed for the lab rooms
	- reach out to eh&s about the plexiglass holders - maybe look on an office supply website
