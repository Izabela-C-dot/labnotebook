# notes

## 10:30 virgins collection
- all ppk bottles molded, tossed all bottles and tossed flies collected today
	- check for mold BEFORE collection
- visual virgin collection went well however

	- emailed to myself, just need to open and actually bookmark

## maui
- Monday - contact akira with princess to get a look at the tuthill system
- for ANY rig made in the lab, keep a spread sheet of what is actually used in the actual rig (you will end up buying more than you use) 
	- helps build future rigs - helps see what was actually used - helps the future
- **note** - buy new goggles for the laser room (2-3) need to be certain of the rating before purcahse
