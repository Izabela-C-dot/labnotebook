## 342 10:30
6.17 flies eclosing - collected 2 vials of ppk no atr
wait to see if w1118 males eclose, and then use those + collected w1118 females to start new cross 

label on vials where the flies were collected - in case of mold
labeled bottles with numbers - will continue to label other bottles with numbers + try to keep consistent during flips - want to be able to track what flies came from what bottle JUST IN CASE mold happens again - set precedent for mold flies not getting tested (don't want it in the rig / microscope / dont know how it could affect behavior) so NO MOLDY FLIES

## 2:30 fly collection
- not a lot of makes eclosing yet OR i am misgendering them - some very skinny abdomen females - i checked on arms for sex combs, but dont feel 100% confident in my ability to ID those accurately 
- keep in mind, age at least 5 days just in case
- collected 7 vials ppk:chr no atr, ping sama tomorrow to talk about the w1118 bottles

ALSO for tomorrow morning collection, only visual virgins get kept - everyone else tossed (wayyyy too much time spent last round collecting flies that produced larva, easier to clear them and then collect on the next round - abundance mindset when it comes to the flies)

also, some bottles maybe moldy - keep eye on them + assume it is a food issue

## 4:09
the call is coming from inside the house, you are stressing yourself out
the ONLY thing to do today is
- add notes to obsidian 
- process a package *actually office probably closed, so do this tomorrow*

so just adding obsidian notes! for an hour and a half! give yourself time to get all your thoughts together and on the page - don't freak out

maybe reorganize daily notes to get that huge mess of deliverables out of direct view - organize that there are TODAY deliverables and BG deliverables (collect all BG under a header so you can hide them and only dip in there when you have down time)

- ~~write post 1-1 notes
	- update powerpoint
- write fly genetics notes - including links to agora to read through
