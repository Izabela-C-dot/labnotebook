## agora additions
- write an agora page on how to order flies from bloomington

## etc + long term projects
- look into getting a fridge
	- internal dimensions (what it will fit)
	- external dimensions (how to fit it in the room)

## 342
8/11 6.20 chr-ppk virgins? have larva, tossed
nothing eclosing from 6.17 bottles yet
one w1118 bottle has no signs of life, **may need to start another UAS chr x w1118 cross**

tossed mold smeared agar plates set up yesterday - heard from sal the plates likely have fungicide / antibac already in them 
no mold in 6.17 bottles (yet)

## fly stocks
label and log 3 fly lines in 342, then back to office to add questions and answers to a document

short name - ~~i am writing the name thats on the vial~~
*is it better to be consistent, or to try a lot of different ideas and see which is right? right now i don't know which is correct, so consistency wouldn't help me. try different things, but keep track of what you try and why*

chrX - copy and paste from BDSC, separated by ; (SEMICOLON)

32 - short name is the name on the vial
33 - short name is a shortened version of the transgene
34 - BDSC has 'also known as', list that as short name with information from the vial label added (w; on chrX and gal4 appended to the end)
	split comes before gal4, so under split 'type'

### questions
- attp# keeps showing up, what is it
	- attp40 (on 33) listed as 'docking site' on BDSC
- what are the different parts of the name (*some answers in fly notes*)
- GAL4-UAS / LexAop-(X) what do?

## co2 monitor
a lot of different options, with a lot of different price ranges - calling eh&s to ask for guidance, got given the contact info of megan grenelli - occupational health and safety - and then called to leave a message w/ phone number and email

the lab has lasted this long without one, it is not extremely pressing, and I would rather ask an expert and get a monitor best suited to our specific situation than buy an expensive thing I dont know much about

CALLED BACK - ask the lab whens a good time for monitoring equipment to be in the lab + then we go from there 
find a time, schedule it, run the test, and then go from there (monitor to buy etc)

## talked to sama
- mold likely a food issue - toss flies pulled from bottles that later molded just to be safe
- run actual assays tomorrow - get in the practice
# done
- flushed eyewash
- ordered fly food
- contacted EH&S about a co2 monitor and left a message
- sent order to tu
- checked PS flies for eclosing and mold and tossed larva virgins
- added 3 fly stocks to data base
- checked back on refund for lab coat - went through - still need to find lab coat that fits me
- talked to tu about receipts
- updated 1-1 slides

# to do tomorrow
- THURSDAY 10 AM - put in bloomington order
	- check twist for additional stocks added
	- princess ; 94619 / 94620
- toss all collected ps flies thus far (from bottles that later molded, no chances)
- post agora about writing the batch number on the bottom of food bottles (to track mold - food issue or us issue)
- actually run some PS assays (with non moldy flies)
- CO2 tank time!
