# notes
## 9:43 
- ~~process package
- ~~w1118:chr assay 1 (set timer)
- flipping bottles 
- ~~w1118:chr assay 2 (set timer)
- cross bottles set up (toss old w1118:chr and all prior w1118:chr bottles and set up new)
- ~~w1118:chr assay 3 (set timer)
- fly food pick up and plug

ACTUALLY i had removed the w1118 flies from the list, because the bottle later molded, so I'm not certain on their age AND I had forgotten to label the vials SO no assays today

uhh can i autoclave atr food
- its just irritation, and there is so little in the actual food, and it'll be in vials that are only partially permeable

## 10:29
- ~~go check on fly food
	- checked and not there, check again at like 12
- ~~flip
- ~~cross

## 11:42 
- ~~check for fly food~~ *no fly food, assume not coming this week*
- ~~grab sweets for meeting?
- *monday* check for co2
- powerpoint
- add fly stocks to list
- look up how to set up fly quarantine + write agora

## 14:00
- ~~powerpoint
- fly stocks on list

## quarantine notes
- do we need an incubator? no, we'll do it on the counter with a thermometer + humidity measure in 332 - may need to order
- i dont want to put these quarantining flies under the microscopes and risk contamination that way, so it will be eyeballing all of this

1) label the received date on the original vial of flies, label it 'g0'
	1) keep this vial for at least 3 weeks, inspect it regularly for mites and mite eggs / fungus / bacteria
2) when adults eclose, transfer them to a new vial labeled 'f1'
3) once it is clear that the new culture is doing well, transfer some f1 adults into a new vial, label that vial 'f2'
4) after f2 is shown to be growing well, and mites have not been found at any point in the process, some f2 flies can be transferred to a new vial and then brought into the lab

basic procedure, give some times (about how long does it tale to see if a culture is doing well)

seems like this all just needs a vial box, a thermometer and time
