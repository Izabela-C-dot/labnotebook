- *continue to cut this into small pieces to work on in the background*

## etc + long term projects
- look into getting a fridge
	- internal dimensions (what it will fit)
	- external dimensions (how to fit it in the room)

	- work with EHS to determine how to get rid of the sigmacote, preferably by exchanging it / giving it to another lab on campus
- adding fly stocks to the database
	- using flystock notes taken with sama 
	- add 2-3 by wednesday in downtime
	- make a document of questions, then answer those questions
		- add any questions that i cant answer myself to the document shared with sama
- add my own zoom meeting with shilpi onto my personal lab calendar 
# notes
## add this to [[weekly meetings with sama]]
organize weekly meetings like the quarterly (upcoming goals, reflecting on work done on various goals) to get into the habit of setting and reflecting often

dont add or remove research goals, make a note of changes and pivots in your slide show
use the slide show as a rolling collection of completed things

## check on the status of the co2 tank we ordered
- workday says it has been successfully delivered
- go check the basement for the tank
- how will i know which tank is ours? have the code from the tag written somewhere to refer to when i go down there 

## ordering myself 12:01 PM
OKAY
- ~~take flies up to autoclave and set timer
	- *started at 12:20*
- ~~make new yeast traps
- ~~flip flies
	- ~~flip UAS chr
	- ~~flip ppk and w1118
- ~~pull flies
	- *instead of pulling, im going to be clearing because these flies look old and i dont want to risk it*
	- ~~will pull flies at 4 pm after clearing
- ~~check flies for larva and mold
	- *no larva in uas chr virgins in the incubator* 
- ~~make PS tracking sheet for myself
- ~~make prometheus and atr food tracking sheet for mary and myself
- ~~make fly food tracking sheet for myself , combine with hibah~~
Reevaluate from this point

## 2:19
~~LUNCH - i need to eat lunch~~
~~handle the autoclave bag (remove from autoclave and cool for an hour)~~
~~get more water~~
~~4ish order bloomington stock~~
~~sheets + tracking sheets ~~
	check if hibah got back to me
powerpoint!

## virgins
6.3 ? and one non ? virgin larva showed up on the side walls, all tossed

## uas chr
tossed oldest UAS CHR bottles
tossed second oldest bottles, because of mold on the side

marked new bottles on the bottom with food batch - i think the food from the ppk bottles and these new molded bottles was from the same batch

## ppk and w1118
mold on the inside of bottles from 6.14 and 6.11

marys bottles from the same time have no mold on the sides or mold in the food - so maybe she pulled from a different batch of food and maybe it is being carried by the flies 

6.17 bottles have larva on the sides, but they are white / yellow and no flies have shown up

## bloomington order
- go through the whole order process and THEN write an agora
- make sure i look up quarantine procedures for the flies before they arrive - coordinate with sama about where to quarantine them

## budget numbers
sama ahmed
hey @Izabela C â€” looks like we have $1800 left in the BWF PDEP. Use that for the next set of purchases (including maui stuff that would normally go on the simons grant)
