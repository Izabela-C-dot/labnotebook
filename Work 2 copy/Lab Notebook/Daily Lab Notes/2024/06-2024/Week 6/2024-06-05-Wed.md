- Write down my thoughts and make a plan of attack 
	- cut things into small chunks, and start SOMEWHERE

- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30

## Consumables Project
- look over the sheet again and reorganize
	- format the sheet so individual rows can be copied and pasted into the weekly purchases sheet
- clarify the consumables on the list - brands, sizes, specifications that are important
	- i want like the actual actual items (instead of 'gloves' - > 'small nitrile gloves')
- recheck the consumables list and add things
- add secondary vendor for consumables 
- introduce list to lab members  
	- ask them to read over it and add things

- first baseline consumables check
	- based on this first check, add locations of consumables and reorganize sheet to be based on location
