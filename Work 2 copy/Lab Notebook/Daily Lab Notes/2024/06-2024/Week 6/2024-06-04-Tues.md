# To Do

## Personal Space
- ~~10:30 virgins
- ~~4:30 virgins
- write protocols in the back of physical lab notebook for reference
- ~~clean up current set of obsidian protocols 
	- check them with Karin for mutual understanding

## ETC
- ~~flush eyewash
- ~~order fly food
- ~~add things to order sheet
- ~~send order sheet to tu
- ~~update purchase sheet and supply sheet (IR Lights)
- ~~update weekly 1-1 slides

342
- take out trash and recycling
- ~~autoclave fly bag
- toss old apple cider vinegar traps
- check 5.3 and 5.10 food for mold *i dont fell like its the clearest and sharpest test, but it is only meant to be preliminary / informal*
332
- ~~test glassware 
	- mark if incorrect and HOW MUCH incorrect
	- write out how i tested the glassware in notes

## Lab organization
more of a background task as I go through my day
- unpacking
- organizing
- tidying
- light consumable checking
look for things to add to the lab clean up sheet 
**pick day + put on calendar for lab cleanup**

## Safety Project 
- ~~Make a list of things to purchase for the lab
	- ~~spill kit - would it be better to buy materials to assemble my own, or to buy a premade one?
- Go thorugh notes and make lists
	- documents that need to be included in the lab binders
	- ~~objects that need to be present in the lab 
- Write down my thoughts and make a plan of attack 
	- cut things into small chunks, and start SOMEWHERE

- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30

## Consumables Project
- look over the sheet again and reorganize
	- format the sheet so individual rows can be copied and pasted into the weekly purchases sheet
- clarify the consumables on the list - brands, sizes, specifications that are important
	- i want like the actual actual items (instead of 'gloves' - > 'small nitrile gloves')
- recheck the consumables list and add things
- add secondary vendor for consumables 
- introduce list to lab members  
	- ask them to read over it and add things

- first baseline consumables check
	- based on this first check, add locations of consumables and reorganize sheet to be based on location

## protocols
sent current obsidian protocols to karin, she'll look and comment when she gets around to it

# Notes
## orders
add to order sheet
- ~~new glassware~~ *tested glassware, no large inaccuracy, so no need to buy*
- ~~clear box for big flugs in 332 - for fly traps~~ *not a priority rn, save ordered organizational solutions for when you have a clearer idea of what to do*
- ~~stepladders for 332 and 342~~ *grab one for right now, see how useful it is and then decide if we need a different one for each space*
- ~~vial flugs

BEFORE i do order sheet things, i need to look at the glassware - test it, make notes on what we have, and then make notes on what to order (i don't want to get things if they won't be used)
## glassware test
- filled with the serological pipette up to 2/3 or 3/4 of total capacity
- the only one to toss is the spectrum graduated cylinder 
let sama know
