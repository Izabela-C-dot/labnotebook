	- mark incorrect glassware
	- write what im doing to test the glass ware
- ~~refill small flug boxes~~
## Lab Organization 
background task as I'm in the lab spaces 
- unpacking items
- organizing items (like goes with like, but not moving too too much)
- combine with consumables check
## Safety Project 
- ~~Make a list of things to purchase for the lab
	- ~~spill kit - would it be better to buy materials to assemble my own, or to buy a premade one?
- Go thorugh notes and make lists
	- documents that need to be included in the lab binders
	- ~~objects that need to be present in the lab 
- Write down my thoughts and make a plan of attack 
	- cut things into small chunks, and start SOMEWHERE

- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30

## Consumables Project
- look over the sheet again and reorganize
	- format the sheet so individual rows can be copied and pasted into the weekly purchases sheet
- clarify the consumables on the list - brands, sizes, specifications that are important
- recheck the consumables list and add things
- add secondary vendor for consumables 
- introduce list to lab members  
	- ask them to read over it and add things

- first baseline consumables check
	- based on this first check, add locations of consumables and reorganize sheet to be based on location

# Notes

## Analog notes copy
i need to word vomit notes from the past three days here AND THEN i'll organize them out. i need to get them down before I get them organized 

word vomit notes and then organize them
### Non-fly lab trash
it can just get thrown away
- if it's in a clear bag, put it next to he trashcans in the hallway
- if it's not in a clear bag, take it to the dumpster yourself
### Flipping bottles and collecting virgins
bottles get flipped every 2-3 days or 3-4 days, depending on what's in the bottle (double check  + add notes later)

when virgins begin to eclose, you are collecting virgins every single day

use the clock method - flies can't procreate for several hours after eclosing, so if you collect them at 10:30 and at 4:30, you can be reasonably certain that you'll have virgin flies 
- 18C - takes about 18 hours to be able to procreate
- 25C - takes about 8 hours to be able to procreate

if you aren't sure if a fly is a virgin or not, add a '?' to the bottle and age them for 5 days - they should begin laying eggs / seeing evidence of them not being a virgin in that time

*should i be moving the flies to the 25C during the week / in between the 10:30 and 4:30 virgin collection?*
- i think yes - add this [[Flipping and Virgins]] - flies go into the incubator between 10:30 and 4:30 and then into the cold room overnight

currently I am collecting G1 flies - the parents of the first flies to be tested
THURSDAY - Mary and I will talk about setting up crosses of these g1 flies to produce F1 - the first testing set

### Testing in 365 notes
- put the petri dish on ice, and count the flies on ice so they stay anaesthetized throughout 
- if a fly lands outside of the testing arena, do not use it in tests
- after using the fly putter to get them out of the petri dish, you can use a paintbrush for some more detail oriented gentle movements
- during testing - turn on the power strip below the table to turn on the IR lights - unplug the other light strip to cut down on light during testing
- **Important** you need to hit CTRL + S to save *twisted Karin to find out WHEN you need to hit that and saving WHAT*
- save videos and csv files to Karin - > data (make new video and csv specific folders)
- Add your initials at the end of the video to show that you are the person conducting the test - important for future proofing
- flies go on their SIDE when in the ice, so they don't get stuck in the food
- after testing the CSV and video files get uploaded to the psych server 
- accessing the psych server - type "\\\\ 172.25.226.40" in the start bar - then go to 'AhmedLab', then 'dat' then 'proxemics' then 'pc-ppkchr-f' to save csv and video
- ice gets dumped into shared lab space sink
### setting up crosses
both mary and karin need crosses set up

mary - pip10 males and chr females
karin - ppk males and chr females

8-10 males and 8-10 virgin females in a bottle together, flip every **2-3 days**
gather virgin females **WITHOUT STUBBY** ie with long hairs on the back of the head 
put the flies on ATR for 2-7 days (age is the time they are on ATR) and then test 
try and house sums of 5 together

if im not sure if I have virgin females - put them on ATR and age them for 5 days
*i have a note about flipping every 10 days in here, but i'm not sure what it refers to*

*ooo a thing i can do, gather ATR virgin female flies, put them on ATR and then start testing as soon as I can (ie i have the range of 2-7 days to test, so if i have a lot of flies, i can portion out testing days between those)*

*once i get crosses set up, ill set up a calendar alert for flips*

crosses get combined labels - grab labels from mary's box

mary and I are going to set up crosses on thursday

*i need to make a list of all the bottles + stocks that I am responsible for and their flip schedule*
- i believe that G1 (parent) flies get flipped every 3-4 days and then F1 (test) flies get flipped every 2-3 days
- Bottles I'm in charge of 
	- Karin's 4 ppk-chr fly bottles

### ATR food production
-- from when we made the ATR stock + then the ATR food --
1mL of ATR solution for every 100mL food
- track the number of bottles you use per ATR batch, 1 bottle is ~50mL of food, use at least 2 (more reasonable to use 4) when making batches of ATR food

Microwave the food in 10-20 second increments, stirring as you heat it to be fully liquid (needs to be melted enough to be pippetted)

Once the food is the right consistency, allow it to cool to hot tub temperature before adding the ATR stock solution (ATR is heat and light sensitive)

Using the serological pipette, move the desired amount of food into a beaker (this allows the ratio of ATR solution to food to be more exact)

Add the required amount of ATR solution to this small beaker of food, and mix it using the spatula

Ensure that all test tubes are inside of sleeves before pipetting food into them, to protect the ATR food from the light

Pipette 3-5 mL of food into each test tube

Cover the test tubes with cheesecloth and allow them to fully cool

Once the tubes are fully cooled, use kimwipes to remove condensation from the inside of the tubes, and then plug them

Place plugged and sleeved ATR food tubes into 25C incubator to be used
