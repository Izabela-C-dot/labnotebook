	- check and add things as I check

# Notes
## consumables 
step 1: open the sheet + read - i think the first thing is organizing the sheet based on consumable TYPE not location
(maybe later, when im actually checking weekly, i could make another list that is location centered for easier use, but for this sheet it should be type focused)

conditional formatting - add more

redid conditional, added more things to the 
### add to consumables
- ~~yeast
- ~~wd-40
- ~~swiffer pads
- ~~packing tape
- ~~hot glue sticks
- ~~petri dishes (60x15 mm and 100x15 mm)
- ~~large flugs 
- ~~serological pipettes
- ~~static free measuring boats

## crosses
crosses set up with mary, flip on monday and then every other day after that
keep the bottles in the incubator 
no curly and no stubby when pulling flies to test

need to check about balancers 
- short and sweet - have the balancer, they dont have the wanted gene so you can sort out all of the flies with the balancer
need to check about co2 sterility
- more than 10 minutes = sterile (i feel like i havent gotten anywhere close with this)

need to check in on the last cart part

## eeee
the co2 tank is empty on the right side - need to swap it - figure out how (sal + ehs)
