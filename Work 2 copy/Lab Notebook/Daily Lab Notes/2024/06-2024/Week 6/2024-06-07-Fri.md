# focus of this week
- Personal space project - cleaning protocols and doublechecking them with Karin / copying into notebook / collecting virgins / setting crosses 
- lab maintenance - orders, autoclave, trash, cleaning + organizing 


# to do 

## personal space 
- ~~flip bottles
- ~~10:30 virgins
- ~~4:30 virgins~~
*karin said - done with grabbing virgins, so im not flipping those bottles or collecting more virgins*

## etc
- ~~12 - pick up fly food
- ~~1 - lunch with amanda~~
	- rescheduled

- 3 - kyle

- write requisition protocol - guide + tu email
- ~~check agora - expended tanks
	- nothing on the agora, reached out to hibah over twist
- ~~move work obsidian to work computer
## consumables
- introduce to lab members (plan to do it, with the order sheet, maybe make a presentation to give + it would serve as more detailed instructions for people)
- continue my baseline checking

## Safety Project 
- ~~Make a list of things to purchase for the lab
	- ~~spill kit - would it be better to buy materials to assemble my own, or to buy a premade one?
- Go through notes and make lists
	- documents that need to be included in the lab binders
	- ~~objects that need to be present in the lab 
- Write down my thoughts and make a plan of attack 
	- cut things into small chunks, and start SOMEWHERE

- pick up a pad of UW hazardous waste labels 
	- HSB J-014 - not 12 to 1, not after 3:30

# notes

## co2 tank
- reached out to sama about the tank
	- the lab installed them, someone will show me how to next week
	- **look through the agora / contact hibah - where do expended tanks go?**

set up obsidian on the big computer, but obsidian sync costs money - not sure if i want to switch (it would lock me to the computer, maybe i could ask about paying + getting reimbursed because i dont want to be stuck and outdated if i work from home, but i also dont want to have to give over my laptop if uw requests it)

late on the 1030 virgins - busy with computer, not sure if i even need them rn - so im going to do a 10:30 CLEAR instead of collection

## safety
