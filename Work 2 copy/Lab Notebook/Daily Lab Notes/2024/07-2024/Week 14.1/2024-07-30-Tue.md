## 14:35
- ~~measure fridge spaces 
	- door way, interstitial space, cold room, tray with vials
- ask mary rig question
- ~~collection~~
## fridge
*i need to say that the spaces are SMALLER than they really are, so i am certain that any components WILL fit in the space*
all measurements underestimates of varying degree
- tray with vials
	- height - 4.5 inches
	- length - 10.25 inches
	- width - 10.25 inches
- exterior door
	- width - 30 inches
	- height - greater than 72 inches
- interstitial space
	- 70 inches square (under estimate)
- interior door
	- 30 inches wide
- cold room
	- 42 inches from the cooler to the wall
	- 30 inches from the outlet to the corner

NOTES 
- fridges make the space outside of them warmer 
	- how will this affect the temperature of the incubation room, and would the cooler in there be enough to keep it at the right temperature for the flies
	- can the cooler be turned to a lower temperature? to counteract the heat a fridge would give off?
- inside the fridge should be 4 degrees C or lower 

not looking at science fridges (thousands of dollars more)
