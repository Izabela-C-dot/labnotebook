## flies
- 3 vials of chr:ppk yes atr flies collected, from bottles with maybe mold on them 
- will talk to sama and then reevaluate if i need to toss the bottles + the 7.3 flies
- 6.24 flies have started eclosing

- likely waste and not mold, stop tossing bottles
- take photos and send to sama before tossing the next bottles

[[2024-07-02-Tue]]
## ps flies
- collected 1 vial of ? virgins for chr:w1118, plan to test on the 9th

- five vials of chr:ppk no atr molded, tossed

[[2024-07-01-Mon]]
## PS and UAS-Chr virgins
- all 6.21 chr:ppk flies were moldy + tossed
- 1 UAS-chr bottle moldy + tossed
- 3 new vials of UAS-Chr virgin females collected

## 10:30 virgins collection
- all ppk bottles molded, tossed all bottles and tossed flies collected today
	- check for mold BEFORE collection
- visual virgin collection went well however 
	- feel more confident about 6/26 collections - more males eclosing and the difference is very clear - sex combs very dark + genitals distinctly different even when the flies are recently eclosed

[[2024-06-26-Wed]]
## 2:30
- not a lot of makes eclosing yet OR i am misgendering them - some very skinny abdomen females - i checked on arms for sex combs, but dont feel 100% confident in my ability to ID those accurately 
- keep in mind, age at least 5 days just in case
- collected 7 vials ppk:chr no atr, ping sama tomorrow to talk about the w1118 bottles

ALSO for tomorrow morning collection, only visual virgins get kept - everyone else tossed (wayyyy too much time spent last round collecting flies that produced larva, easier to clear them and then collect on the next round - abundance mindset when it comes to the flies)

also, some bottles maybe moldy - keep eye on them + assume it is a food issue

## 10:30
6.17 flies eclosing - collected 2 vials of ppk no atr
wait to see if w1118 males eclose, and then use those + collected w1118 females to start new cross 

label on vials where the flies were collected - in case of mold
labeled bottles with numbers - will continue to label other bottles with numbers + try to keep consistent during flips - want to be able to track what flies came from what bottle JUST IN CASE mold happens again - set precedent for mold flies not getting tested (don't want it in the rig / microscope / dont know how it could affect behavior) so NO MOLDY FLIES

[[2024-06-25-Tue]]
8/11 6.20 chr-ppk virgins? have larva, tossed
nothing eclosing from 6.17 bottles yet
one w1118 bottle has no signs of life, **may need to start another UAS chr x w1118 cross**

tossed mold smeared agar plates set up yesterday - heard from sal the plates likely have fungicide / antibac already in them 
no mold in 6.17 bottles (yet)

[[2024-06-24-Mon]]
## virgins
6.3 ? and one non ? virgin larva showed up on the side walls, all tossed

## uas chr
tossed oldest UAS CHR bottles
tossed second oldest bottles, because of mold on the side

marked new bottles on the bottom with food batch - i think the food from the ppk bottles and these new molded bottles was from the same batch

## ppk and w1118
mold on the inside of bottles from 6.14 and 6.11

marys bottles from the same time have no mold on the sides or mold in the food - so maybe she pulled from a different batch of food and maybe it is being carried by the flies 

6.17 bottles have larva on the sides, but they are white / yellow and no flies have shown up

[[2024-06-21-Fri]]
there are a LOT of moldy bottles, i tossed them all AND i tossed all the flies that I gathered from those bottles - consistency and quality are the most important things

[[2024-06-20-Thu]]
pulled flies from 6.10, and put them on non ATR food to age (at least until 6.25 to see if they are virgins or not)

11 containers of flies - 5.5 hours, aged 2-7 days

need to make a tracking sheet for ps things

a lot of moldy food, need to toss, will do today so there is more space for new food tomorrow

[[2024-06-17-Mon]]
- asked mary if she wants me to collect her virgins and flip her bottles continually
	- *Dont collect or flip for mary, she is back and has it covered*
- ppk bottles from 6.6 both had mold, both tossed

blech co2 makes my mouth taste weird

i need to ask what to do if flies keep just dying in the food, can i refill the stock bottles and if so how?

[[2024-06-14-Fri]]
flipped f1 bottles
- moved ? 6/13 flies to 9 incubator
- double checked f1 bottles for gender markers

[[2024-06-11-Tue]]
stock flipped
- new cross bottles made

[[2024-06-10-Mon]]
flipped crosses - flip again friday

[[2024-06-07-Fri]]
- flipped bottles
- 10:30 virgins
- 4:30 virgins
*karin said - done with grabbing virgins, so im not flipping those bottles or collecting more virgins*

[[2024-06-06-Thu]]
crosses set up with mary, flip on monday and then every other day after that
keep the bottles in the incubator 
no curly and no stubby when pulling flies to test

need to check about balancers 
- short and sweet - have the balancer, they dont have the wanted gene so you can sort out all of the flies with the balancer
need to check about co2 sterility
- more than 10 minutes = sterile (i feel like i havent gotten anywhere close with this)

need to check in on the last cart part
