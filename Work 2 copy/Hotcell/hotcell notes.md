# hot cell
## crosses
- talk to mateo about grabbing some of his UAS-Hotcell flies
- talk to lydia about grabbing some of her canton s flies

SET UP AND MAINTAIN THESE FLY STOCKS FOR HOTCELL
## trouble shooting
- talk to mary
	- male / female ID system is on hold for mary and mateo, so its higher priority for me rn
	- talk to mary about whats going on with it - whats wrong and what she thinks is happening

### two main things to troubleshoot
- bonsai 
	- the ID model flipping, whats going on with the code to make weird things happen
- genetics
	- opto dosage / genotype / how can we get the flies to learn what we want them to learn

THREE GOALS
- males on one side of the arena
- females on both sides of the arena
- they attempt social behaviors

play with contingencies
- how is bonsai triggering?
- change the dosage - have it ramp up with more time spent on the hot side?
- wait a certain time with the male on the hot side before triggering
- mark the hot side visually
