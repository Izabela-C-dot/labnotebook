Quarter Launch 1-1 with sama on [[2024-06-17-Mon]]

Quarter Launches are the 1-1 meetings at the beginning of each quarter - used to set expectations and goals for the upcoming quarter

Quarter goals are meant to be feasible, but ambitious - the goal is to have 80% of each goal completed by the end of the quarter (60% indicates goal too hard / too many goals - 100% indicates not ambitious enough)

# goals
(goals from the spring-summer 2024 slideshow)

- Develop a systematized schedule for raising, collecting, aging and testing the flies to make the process run smoothly, and serve as a structure for future project schedules
	- Put together a mock calendar (e.g. day 1, etc) for the personal space project as a template in the agora
	- Write an FAQ (with tips and tricks) for setting up fly experiments in the agora
    
- Progress on the Personal Space project - I want to complete as many assays as possible this summer
    - Run all three conditions for n=5 flies (n=60 total assays)
	- Run at least 50% of n=10 flies (n=30 total assays, minimum)

- Beginning work on Maui - I want to work with Princess and Carter on the fly on the ball rig and gain skills to help build the sample rig for Maui
	- Build the saline flowthrough system
	- Support Carter and Princess w/their respective contributions

## maui

I am in charge of building the Maui saline flowthrough system - saline needs to be constantly flowing over the exposed fly brain, with oxygen and nitrogen mixed into it to keep the brain alive as it's being examined

the 2p microscope and the fly brain are connected through the bubble of saline - the meniscus attaches them

the saline needs to flow in a be pumped out, will / can include multiple components including - pump, tubing, needles, 3d printed components, syringes, carbogen tank, flow controller, vaccumm to remove old saline etc

Maui Saline Resources
- Tuthill Lab - Akira
- Christa Baker - pump things

I'm the lead on saline, carter is lead on fly on the ball, princess is lead on actually preparing flies and getting data - the three of us and sama will have weekly meetings to ensure cohesion 

**check maui agora for resources and connections**
- charles - nap center, good at working with his bruker system, reach out to him with questions

## general

Research progress is the most important thing - research is the indicator of success

all purchasing and safety things also need to be completed, but research is the most important thing
