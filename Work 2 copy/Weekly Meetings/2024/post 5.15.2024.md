post 1-1 with sama and hibah from [[2024-05-15-Wed]]

# Workday + Purchasing
- Hibah made a workday verification video and it's in the ahmed server
- Workday prefers PDFs to screenshots, some screenshots show up empty in workday 
- Get verifications done ASAP so they don't pile up and so problems are solved quickly
- Check the mailbox on the first floor, you won't get notifications when there are things there
# Points of Friction Hibah noticed
## Purchasing
- Hibah noticed that purchasing was a huge headache, it will be good to make a centralized system for orders
	- All members add the product to a purchase sheet + I mark when the things has actually been purchased AND when it was checked (a lot of vendors will send confirmation emails a few days after the actual purchase) AND the expected date
	- Make a system, try it for 3 months, think back on it. 
	- Not having materials shouldn't be the thing that stalls work. make it part of the workflow to check every 3-4 days on order status 
		- *a spread sheet where members can add products - orders are made on tuesday each week, so make sure all materials are entered into the sheet by 5pm monday at the latest - i do orders on tuesdays and i check order status + confirmation on fridays + each few days afterwards - section on the spread sheet where I can indicate if a product has been ordered + if confirmation has been received + the expected date + any notes on status if delayed etc - this is a separate sheet than the purchases and orders, which is a collected centralized document to keep record of things - cleaner to use a new one and just copy it over, maybe inefficient, but that can be evaluated after using this*
		- *this will ensure that the person ordering the material is the one checking that they are ordering the right material - they give the link, cat no. etc and i provide that to tu*
	- Talk to sama about devising an orders and purchases system in 2 weeks (28th)
		- *id like to have a structure set up by then, that he and i can edit+work on together*

- Vendors can SUCK
	- amazon will cancel orders without email notification
	- Linde/Praxair will say an order has shipped without it actually being shipped
	- Tu and Rebecca Johnson in finance department are helpful when dealing with vendors

## Lab Space
- the lab space can be pretty disorganized, a lot of loose objects, unsure if anyone is using things or if we can get rid of them - hard to find things and it wastes time
- sama suggested doing a lab clean up day at the end of the summer, where everyone can be in the space together cleaning and organizing and getting rid of unused things

# Karin's Project
Karin has a really cool project planned - protocol written - but is going to be out of state for the summer
SO for the next **2 weeks** while she's still here, I'm going to talk with here about what she's doing, why she's doing it, getting familiar with the drive and the protocol to carry out data collection while she's gone

- Get trained on working with flies by someone (hibah/mary/karin/lydia)
	- sexing + using the trays + pushing
- Get familiar with the protocol
	- what experiments does karin have planned
	- what is the protocol for these experiments
	- why are we running these experiments, whats the drive
- dry runs using the software
	- how to record video
	- how to start and stop recordings
	- where to upload videos

# Et cetera 
- get access to the Ahmed lab server to access Hibah's video on doing purchase verifications in workday
- Princess, who is rejoining the lab, worked on maui with kyle before I was here, so I assume the two of us will be able to work together
## Dead Flies
related to [[Dead Fly disposal]] project
sama has emailed some people and got very by the book answers on what they do with their flies, which may not be what they actually do with the flies

- reach out to EH&S and ask what other fly labs do to dispose of their flies
	- *ask this when I have a couple more questions, like what kind + how many fire extinguishers we need*
