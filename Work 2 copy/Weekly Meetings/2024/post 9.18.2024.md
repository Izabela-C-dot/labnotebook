hey youre doing enough, this is part of the learning process. let your research goals guide you if you dont think youre doing enough

goals for this upcoming quarter include finding better balance between lab management and research tasks
- fill in tasks in the autumn sheet
- fill in time estimates
- routine - ify the process for all of the maintenance tasks (similar to the ordering sheet, make it simple and fast)

## Enki
- tubing should be changed once every month (ideally) and once every quarter minimum
- measure tubing OD and length and record that 

### Enki to do 
- Set up the needles holding
- Make 3D print available on psych server
- Run flow tests to balance in/out
- Measure tubing lengths 
- Update components list
- draw a schematic of enki
- Write an agora on enki
	- how was enki built
	- what did i use to build enki
	- how to operate enki
	- how to clean enki / how to replace tubing
		- tube lengths + where all the tubes connect
	- troubleshooting enki

## research goals
my goals are based on what projects need support

big one for autumn - fly on the ball
- goal - 2 operational versions of the fly on the ball (one for maui and one in 365 or 342) AND get a full data set completed by the end of the quarter
- what to do - get the fly on the ball operational, run flies on it to prove the design, add a z lift function for the non-Maui atlas

if atlas is fine - help princess collect data and do dissections OR help kyle collect data

stay in good communication with carter, helping and encouraging and keeping him getting tasks done (metadata sheet)

youre FINE
