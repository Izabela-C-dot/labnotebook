talked about lab upkeep - sama was receptive - will announce to the lab + rocketeers
- comes down to a communication breakdown + lack of clear expectations
- im glad i talked about this

make an autoclave agora w/ best practices
add trash information on main lab chancellorship agora

troubleshooting the bubbler
- the long pipe goes to the co2, the short pipe goes to the plate and the gun

- water in the fly plate not a big deal - use the small compressed air tank to flush the plate and the gun
- flush tubing (spin it to dry it)
- fresh water on the left bubbler
- replace the flask on the left bubbler - something with a tighter fit on the plug

take a picture of a full fly trash and add it to the agora
