sama says it is okay to use flies from bottles that later mold, so long as they were not collected when the mold was already growing in the bottles, should be fine
- keep this in mind in case things get weird down the line though, just in case
so, i dont need to track bottles of origin for those vials of flies

we were meant to check the w1118:chr bottles after the meeting, but the meeting went on too long so i am going to chat with him tomorrow
likely - just set up new w1118:chr crosses (3 bottles? 4 bottles?) and use those, because the current bottles aint doing nothing

coordinate with mary about atr food
make a batch every 2ish weeks AND keep track of when the food was made on the sheet
- 6/26 - messaged mary to start this process

powerpoint
- sama says it all looks good, add a link to the sheets in the powerpoint and be ready to lead people (in teams of 2?) through a demonstration (links, and links to various items so people can practice adding them (one amazon, one non amazon))

Maui
- look on the twist for messages akira (tuthill lab saline contact) sent lydia about this same procedure - read through those messages AND THEN contact akira (ask about the pump and ask to see the system)
- 3:30 - maui mob meeting with sama to chat 

CO2 
- don't involve EH&S - bureaucratic mess
- instead, independently research a co2 alarm (to be used for when co2 levels are unsafe, makes noise, check ppm upper limit measurement ability (only needs to measure up to beginning unsafe levels and then go off - like, if theres a leak))
- email back 'actually don't worry, adjusted SOPs and now no longer a concern'

then some more fly learning and notes - to be transferred into fly notes + fly line labeling notes
