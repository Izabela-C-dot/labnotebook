## compressed gas SOP

sama says it looks good
- make sure I have the copy he edited in the meeting - *in the dropbox*
- remove the draft watermark
- print
- PI sign

and then all thats left is getting everyone acquainted with the safety documents and completing the lab specific training records and then we're done!

also yay! sama approves work from home half days on fridays - test with fridays and see if we can extend to other days maybe?
