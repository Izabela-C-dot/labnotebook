**Priority** - ENKI AND ATLAS this week

Enki and Atlas
- fly on the ball and enki set up are the priority 
- *contact carter + see what he can do before he leaves / get a time table for what he can do for atlas - I need the atlas table set up so I can set up enki in the correct way*
- sama wants atlas done before fall
3D modeling - make the new sample holder with needle guides
- *talk to mary about learning how to 3d print*
- *message carter about having a folder on the psych server with all of the 3d models*
- *work on designing multiple versions of the new holder, looking for a balance between bulk and needle support - V1 V1 V1*

We had an entire tray of food from 8/23 (so a little over two weeks) completely mold
- new fly chefs, problems to be expected
- only lydia + karin/i are collecting flies daily right now
- *ask lydia if she needs more food to guide if i should order a set of bottles this week*
- *take photos of the moldy food*
- *ask anne sustar and john if their food is also moldy - see if they are getting moldy food so sama knows to shout at the chefs about it*
- *on friday take all the old gross trays back to the lab - keep a few of the cleaner trays IN the lab - clean out the 18*

Liminal Space before autumn quarter
- *new stocks to label and organize - on my desk*
- *Write a new agora for cross bottle labeling etiquette* 
	- anyone should be able to drop in on any cross and know whats going on and what to do
	- use photos of lydia's bottles for reference
	- best practices - avoid placing vials and bottles into the same tray
	- things that need to be labeled / best practiced
		- color coding (according to the different genotypes, and actual crosses use the two colors) 
		- labeling boxes (collect go, f1, f1 to test etc) and with names and projects 
		- female genotype on the left, male on the right
		- date the bottles DATE THE BOTTLES and vials
		- draw the symbol thats being collected on the top of the plug
		- from front to back, oldest to newest
