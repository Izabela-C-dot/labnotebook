## personal space
- after personal space data collection is complete, i will move to either assisting princess on her project, or mary on her's

Mary's projects
- wing extension and multitasking
- hot cell and courtship
i would be jumping in to help troubleshoot the hotcell set up
- the flies are not courting in the arena

look at the 2024 wild type data set on the ahmed lab server

### ideas for how to troubleshoot the hot cell
- add a visual indicator of the hot zone in the arena
- establish a slight light so the flies can see each other better
- let the male acclimate in the arena before adding the female
- add a white dot of elmers glue on the female to allow the bonsai to see the female better
	- less incorrect hotcell triggers on the male, so they can learn the hot zone + not be too stressed to court
- have the flies start courting and then turn on the opto 

play with the parameters!

controls - hotcell genotype, no atr food - get them to court and then play with the opto light

they won't court? 
change the experiment goal to test female proximity and distancing - will a female choose to stay near another female or male or neither

hotcell genotype male - freeroaming female 
hotcell genotype female - freeroaming female

**get courtship first without the opto light, then add the opto**

## fly stocks
- fixed names and moved my stocks to the main box
## safety binder

~~replace my number on page 14 with samas

~~LSP - add 'minor alignment to be performed by trained users with proper eyewear' to the alignment page, and then print!~~

~~change the laser officer on LSP to princess

SOP - compressed gas needed only

~~complete laser registration myself and message sama if need be

## proxemics agora
- after the data set is complete, edit the proxemics agora and then hand to kyle to look over (is this functional or useful?) and then hand off to sama
