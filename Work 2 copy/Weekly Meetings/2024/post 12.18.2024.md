## kid visit! january 23rd
i am now captain of the kid visit

ideas!
- opto with moonwalker flies
- the kids bring things to see under the micrscope
- we prep maui videos 
	- behavior fly on the ball synced with neurons lighting up
- 3d print something they can take home! have it running so the kids can see it being printed AND ALSO have some things premade (5 units) so thye can take it home :)

## hot cell
- get in touch with mateo and mary post break
- investigate using a blue light as a teaching signal - flies dont like blue light, if we can use blue it would mean we could do 2 color signalling, which would be super cool
