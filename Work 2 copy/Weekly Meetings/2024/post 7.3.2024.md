## personal space
- you are likely seeing fly waste as mold - hold off on tossing
- take photos of mold and send photos to sama before tossing more bottles
- look for white mold, the stuff on the walls is likely waste

this is good! it means more testing and less tossing

## fly notes
don't include any white genes in the short name 
add a period before landing site
- - IVS - does not get included in the short name, it boosts expression
use more tape on vials to give yourself more space to write
work on the agora list for for transgenes and other markers
