## static stability
- ill be doing morning testing for lydia
- lydia will still be testing and i will be supporting

- run as many tests as possible before december 1st
- regarding the ice tests - the more data we collect, the more dilute any effect using ice to anesthetize the flies becomes

- sama suggested expanding to both rigs *lydia doesnt want to rn - but i will record what we would need to do to expand to both rigs*
	- mark which rig is used in the file name and on the metadata sheet 
	- set up the bright LED lights in prometheus
		- wrap the LED strip through prometheus and epimetheus 
	- record the pixel/mm ratio for both rigs in the metadata sheet
	- move the bonsai protocol for StSt onto the computer for prometheus
		- should be able to be accessed through the ahmed lab server

## safety stuff
- there is a completed compressed gas SOP in the dropbox, look at that and USE that, huge relief

- no need to worry about IACUC - drosophila are not animals in experiments

## lydia's project is higher priority than hotcell - it has a set deadline
