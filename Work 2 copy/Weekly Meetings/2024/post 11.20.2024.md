Lydia!
it is not a time to be creative, it is time for brute force
we are not going to hit the deadline - but we can ramp up

- watch lydia work 
	- how is she collecting flies
- time to amplify bottles 
	- should be collecting females to make experimental cross bottles DAILY
	- 10 and 4 collection, daily
	- at least 4 COLLECTION bottles for EACH genotype so there is a plethora of animals to select
- where are the females?
- why were flies placed on moldy food? moldy food needs to be tossed and not used
- unlabeled box on the top shelf?
- time to use both rigs

incubator!
- brown stuff on the fans - tell darwin chambers AND get things fixed soon
