## bonsai
this is the big one, ive been feeling stalled with bonsai for weeks
(no feelings around it - its noticing and its adjusting, its not a shame or a feelings thing - no reason to be unhappy)

sama and i talked explicitly about expectations around bonsai
- I don't need to know everything (or even that much) before I begin working, the most effective way to learn code is to have a problem and then work to solve it
- to try and to make mistakes
	- **use my slideshow to show snapshots of my workflow to trial and error on**
- can i replicate whats been done already?
	- take marys code for a single fly and a boundary and test it
		- where does it work?
		- where does it fail?
		- what are the points with frustration with it?
	- test hotcell flies or even wild type flies and see what happens
	- play around with parameters and see what changes - make notes and talk about it

**GOAL BY NEXT WEEK**
- test flies (wild type or hotcell) in the single fly + boundary experiment and see what happens
	- it will fail - try and fix it
	- add snapshots of my workflow to my slide 
		- where did i try and fix it?
		- how did it work?
*bela set goals*
- set up a hotcell bottle for myself
- set up a wild type bottle for myself
- have/set up a bonsai meeting with mary and mateo
- start a bonsai thread in the 3metheus channel and ask 1 question
