Weekly slideshows for three purposes
- keep work on track
- share progress
- receive timely feedback
Useful for synchronous and asynchronous communication

prepare slides ahead of time to guide the discussion

The only required slide is an agenda, which briefly summarizes
1. what you've been up to
2. what you're planning to do next
3. any obstacles encountered that you want to discuss 
4. other updates, questions and issues you want to discuss

subsequent slides can contain results, analyses, links to guide discussion etc. *if new results are included, ensure that these results are legible if the slideshow is viewed asynchronously.* these meetings also provide a place to bring up other concerns with sama.

**update slides the day before the weekly meeting with sama**, so he can look at the slides ahead of time and come prepared

**update even if you are not meeting with sama that week**, it may be more bare bones, but updating every week helps keep a consistent record of work completed that can be referred to later on

meetings are held in sama's office (guthrie 333) - if i prefer zoom or phone reach out ahead of time. if scheduling conflicts come up, update sama ASAP, day of cancellations of meetings are discouraged

consider using a [[Gantt charts]], especially when you are early in a project, and add links to this chart in the slide show

## Slideshow instructions 
*quoting this section from the '[how to prepare for weekly meetings with sama](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/how+to+prepare+for+weekly+meetings+with+sama)' page on the agora*
### Platform
- Google Slides, share with [sama](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/sama+ahmed) -> [omahmed@uw.edu](mailto:omahmed@uw.edu) / [sama.ahmed@gmail.edu](mailto:sama.ahmed@gmail.edu)
    - provide _edit_ access
### Your Responsibilities

- Update your slideshow with your progress (attempts, data, questions, screengrabs, plots, etc).
- Prepare your action items for the upcoming week.
- List potential obstacles.
- Check the slides for feedback from sama.
- Be ambitious _and_ realistic with your action items.

### Sama's Commitments

- Provide feedback, insights, and guidance in our weekly meetings.
- Support with resources, ideas, or connections to overcome challenges.
- Review your slides each week and add feedback in a sleek and lovely purple font.

### Slide Structure
Each week, prepare the following:

1. One slide with **Action Items & Obstacles** (this is your agenda slide)
    - **Title**: "Action Items for [Upcoming Week's Date]"
    - Write a check list of _actionable_ tasks for the upcoming week.
    - Indicate potential obstacles, e.g., classes, exams.

Sama (and your horizontal peer support group) can help you prioritize the most impactful work each week. Action items should be actionable, specific, and detailed. It should be clear what "done" and "not done" look like.

e.g.

- **good**: Plot last week's GCaMP data for top 5% most behavior-correlated neurons by Thursday.
- **bad**: Look at GCaMP data.

2. **Progress Slides** updated throughout the week
    - Detail your week's work with data, figures, graphs, sketches, photos, reports, etc.

### Meetings
IRL meetings will typically be 30-60 minutes, and either at the beginning or end of the week

If you need to reschedule a meeting, use the Ahmed Lab calendar to swap slots with a team mate, and send sama a twist message

80% of the meeting is troubleshooting and discussion

### Archival
Archive all slideshows into a chronological order at the end of each quarter

---
### Notes
one slideshow for the whole quarter, slides are chronologically

---
[[2024-06-24-Mon]] Additions from Summer kickoff meeting
organize weekly meetings like the quarterly kick off meetings ( ie upcoming goals, reflecting on work done on various goals, challenges, what went well) to get into the habit of setting and reflecting often

dont add or remove research goals, make a note of changes and pivots in your slide show

use the slide show as a rolling collection of completed things (add to the end of the slide show + continue to add additions)
