## incubators - humidity trank
- carter and i tried to clean the incubators humidity tank right after the meeting and ran into several roadblocks
	- one of the white pipes connecting the humidifier to the incubator does not seem able to be removed, stopping us from moving the humidity unit
		- it has no screw off, like the one shown in the manual, and it doesnt seem like theres a place where it would make sense to be removable
	- extra water tube that isnt listed in the manual and doesnt seem to be easily removable (less a priority than the white pipe)
	- no screwdriver to take the humidifier apart

need to reach out to rich and to darwin to see what is up

## etc
- labeling party
	- carter organize and i support? very loose plans atm
- identifier stickers on cameras
	- ahmed lab, if found call XXX etc because they are small cameras and easy to lose
