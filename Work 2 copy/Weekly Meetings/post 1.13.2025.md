## kid visit
- you are too focused on this - its good to put in energy but this should not be your main priority

### deliverables from this meeting
- princess has an nsyb>GCaMP cross already set up - reach out to her to get a flip of it
	- if i get this by 1/18 (ie 5 days before the kid visit) i will have larva i can use
- check the video camera on the microscope station
- check that i can access yellow light (tdtom) or blue light (GCaMP) to trigger the glow in the nsyb larva
	- *what lights are used to trigger this? where are they?*
- grab the 2p goggles for the kids to use during the light up portion
- check that we have sucrose in 332
	- no sucrose? order some

flies from the cross bottles should eclose on the 20th 
- isolate a few on ATR
- put the rest in group housing on ATR - no need to make sure they're virgins, just grab everyone
## confusion
- i was confused about hotcell and 3metheus connection - i thought that hotcell was a project under the 3metheus umbrella and was deprioritized relative to developing and troubleshooting 3metheus
- i also assumed i would be assisting mary in trouble shooting and not being the main person doing the troubleshooting, but that was incorrect
	- i AM the main person working on hotcell - it is my responsibility to figure this out

- **stay in 3metheus meetings** - related hardware so it will be useful for me to have information on how this is progressing because my work is reliant upon it
## hotcell / opto fence
- THIS is your main priority
## the goal
- female fly is able to freely move through the chamber, the male fly is only able to move in one half of the chamber 
## how to achieve this goal?
- make a list of everything that could be going wrong and look at what would could have the largest positive effect on the project if addressed
	- what is having the largest negative effect?
	- what would be the easiest to address?
	- what could have the largest positive effect if addressed?
- [[hotcell list]]
