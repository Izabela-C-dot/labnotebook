Hello Chad!

I am reaching out to ask a question and give you some important information for your upcoming visit on January 23rd. 

How old are the children attending the lab tour?

Safety
- There are several safety guidelines to follow when in lab spaces on UW Campus.
	- First, all attendees need to wear lab appropriate clothing. This includes closed toed shoes and long pants.
	- Second, there is no eating or drinking inside any lab spaces.

Photo Policy
- The Ahmed Lab requests that you do not post any photos taken inside of lab spaces on social media.

Parking and Directions
- The Ahmed Lab is in Guthrie Hall on UW Seattle Campus. I plan on meeting you in the lobby of the building to begin the tour, but if I am not there feel free to contact me at (360)-918-1102.
- The closest UW parking garage to Guthrie Hall is the Central Plaza garage. There are also a number of bus routes that bring you directly to Guthrie Hall, including the 67, 75 and 45. The closest light rail station to Guthrie Hall is the University of Washington Station (Stop 48). 
- [Here is a link to the University of Washington campus map](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/gth) which is a very helpful resource when navigating around the university campus

Planned Itinerary
- Planned activities for this lab tour include:
	- Allowing attendees to view items they bring under a microscope
	- Viewing fruit fly larva under the microscope
	- Viewing adult fly behavior in one of our experimental rigs
	- Watching a video of neurons in a flies brain light up as it moves during an experiment
- Due to time constraints we may be unable to complete all of these listed activities

What to bring on Thursday the 23rd
- If you would like, we suggest that you bring several (1-3) objects to look at under the microscope. These objects should be about the size of a deck of cards or smaller for the best results.

We at the Ahmed Lab are looking forward to your visit!

Please reach out if you have any questions.
