what did i do this quarter?

i designed and printed the enki baseplate
i built enki
i worked on personal space and collected all of the needed data
i streamlined and reassigned my background tasks
i made the maui safety binder and we did the first pass of our laser safety walkthrough 
i started the static stability project
i onboarded mateo into fly work (training and set him up)

i feel like i got a much better footing in the lab this quarter - which makes sense, more experience would mean more skill

i gained a lot more technical skill - i am able to train lab members and will have done so twice soon (mateo and a refresher training on carter)

its nice to feel like my time actually is valuable - like i have technical skill past being a pair of available hands

what were my successes?

what were my obstacles?

how do i plan on going about addressing these obstacles in the future?

i feel successful on keeping the background tasks running smoothly at the same time i was working on research tasks - thats something i struggled with previously that i felt i improved on this quarter.
	i streamlined and i delegated and now i feel like i have more time to dedicate to emerging issues and research questions, instead of daily maintenance

it feels good to get data collected and enki built, since those were my first two big projects when i got hired - it feels good to put work into things and see them bear fruit
i like being good at what i do and feeling good at what i do

i got accommodations which is really exciting - im really proud of myself for following through on those needs

obstacles - i feel like i can stall out when i need to do something ive never done before - like it can feel too hard to start so i never start
	worries about being wrong or just not knowing what to do (i dont know what to do, so i dont know the right thing to do but more importantly i dont know the wrong things to do and what if i do a wrong thing) 
	and also maybe its hard or it seems like itll be hard or i think itll be hard and THEN i don't want to do it

BUT this lab is a safe space to fail AND GET BACK UP the time will pass anyways and no one is coming to save you, so you have to do it - enki seemed hard so i put them off, but sama suggested i give it like. dedicated time, longer than i thought i would need to only focus on the one task - and that was really helpful

i feel like ive handled priorities well - some things are high and some are low - i didnt really get stressed about having too much to do, i felt like i was a lot better at managing stress around deliverables - i had a better grasp of what is a high priority to complete and what isnt - of only pushing on things that need to be pushed on AND the realization that a lot of what i do actually doesnt have that tight of a time limit - that my schedule and what gets done is a lot more flexible than i first thought it was - low priority things get handles when they get handled and there isn't really a rush to do them. sometimes projects are stalled - and i dont need to be stressed about it because there's a limit to how much i can affect any one scenario. i cant make flies breed or eclose faster, i can only do what i can do

i feel more connected to the lab - i feel like i have better relationships with more lab members - which makes sense, knowing people longer generally means knowing them better

i still really like this job. i dont want to do workday reconciliations, but even if i have to it wont be the end of the world - weird and obtuse, but i dont need to let it stress me out - if i dont let it affect me, then it cant affect me - i have good separation between myself and work and i feel like if i maintain that i can remove the stress of workday - it will still be frustrating, but frustation is fleeting and i dont need to hold onto it once i leave where the frustration lives
