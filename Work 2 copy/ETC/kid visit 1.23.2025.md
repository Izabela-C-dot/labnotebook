# activities
- looking at objects under the microscope
	- learning how a microscope works
- looking at nsyb>GCaMP larva under the microscope
	- basic description of gene insertion?
- looking at moonwalking/fru flies acting under optogenetic stimulation
	- getting a basic description of how opto stimulation works
- looking at the 2 photon video
	- the neurons are lighting up in time with activation 
	- VERY simple explanation 
		- we can see what the fly is doing - its behavior - and where in the brain the decision to do that thing is being made.
		- different parts of the brain are in charge of different things, and we can see what part of the brain is in control of these behaviors
- we have 3d printed fly figures to give the kids (and parents!)
# question to ask the parent
- how old are the children? 
	- *(2 2nd graders and 1 4th grader)*
- what time did you plan for the visit?
	- *3-4 pm*
- do you have any questions or concerns?
# information to give the parent
- ~~safety information
	- no open toed shoes
	- long pants
	- no eating
	- no drinking
	- no photos inside the lab space / especially no POSTING any photos taken in the lab space
- ~~a loose itinerary of what we will be doing
	- looking at objects under a microscope
	- looking at larva under a micrscope
	- looking at flies performing under optogenetic stimulation (this can include some seizing if we us the fru flies)
- ~~a description of what types of items to bring to look at under the micrscope
	- general size - use a reference - have back up objects to use - check some objects to see what gets the best results
- ~~directions on where to park / where to go / how to get in to the building

# deliverables (organized by activity)
**bold are day of deliverables**

## general
- ~~provide parent information
- ~~ask parent questions

- print 5 copies of the little flat fly 

- determine who wants to help with the kid trip
	- ~~mateo and princess
		- let them know 
			- what time
			- what they need to do / a loose guide of what to hit
	- ~~give specific directions to those helping 0 what needs to happen + what to prep aead of time (essentially provide them with my list here)~~
## microscope 
mateo handling microscope fun times
- ~~check the camera on the left microscope
- ~~check and make sure i can operate it confidently
	- shouldn't need to use CO2 for this 
- ~~find microscope images
	- 1 image with all the parts labeled
	- 1 image that shows how a microscope works
- ~~gather some example items to look at
	- *lab specific objects*

princess handling this - asked if sama told her about the sucrose mix, yet to hear back
- get nsyb flies from princess
	- set up nsyb bottle by at least 1/18 
- ~~check for yellow light (Tdtom) or blue light (GCaMP)
	- where are they?
	- how to use them?
- **bring 2p goggles into 342 for the kids to use during the light trigger**
	- IMMEDIATELY get the goggles back into 359
- learn how to draw the larva out of the bottle
	- dump adults - make viscose sucrose mix - pour sucrose into the vial/bottle - mix into the food - larva will climb out of the food - put the larva into a petri dish to put under the microscope
- get a basic description of gene insertion
	- how do these larva glow? this is just an example of what we can do

## optogenetics
mateo handling opto stuff
- ~~maintain the moonwalker-chr and fru-chr cross
	- flip on *tuesday* and then likely eclose by the *20th*
	- then on ATR
		- some isolated, some group housed
		- no need to ensure virginity - grab everyone
- ~~ensure the opto rig works 
- ~~ensure that i know how to access and operate opto_control
- ~~prepare a basic description of how optogenetics works
	- there are special genes inserted that allow genes to be turned on and off (*?*) depending on if a special light is turned on or off

princess handling this - asked about the ball video + zstack accessibility on computers in 365/342 and have yet to hear back

- ensure that the maui video is functional
- ensure that the maui video is uploaded on to the 365 computers and can be accessed and watched
- prepare a brief BRIEF and simple description of what is happening in the video
	- different parts of the brain are in charge of different things 
	- using a special microscope we can see parts of the brain light up as they are being used
	- we can see what the flies body does - what its behavior is - and see what part of the brain was used in performing that behavior

kid visit is no ones priority, and it shouldn't be - lab tour was promised, activities are all frosting
