**Exploring sleep states and their behavioural correlates in Drosophila**Â   

Sleep is a universal yet diverse phenomenon across the animal kingdom, varying greatly in duration, patterns, and brain activity both within and between animal classes. Drosophila has become a key model for studying sleep, yet its sleep has traditionally been viewed as monophasic, despite recent evidence suggesting underlying multiphasic brain activity. This talk will explore how behavioural tracking and modelling can offer non-invasive insights into sleep quality and patterns. In particular, it will highlight how different Drosophila species have evolved distinct sleep strategies to adapt to their ecological niches.

- can you give us a summary / condensed version of your seminar?
	- specifically im interested in the connections between sleep strategies and ecological niche
- why are you interested in the ahmed lab?
	- what are you seeking in an ideal workplace?
	- what do you value in a workplace? 
	- what other lab groups have you been a part of, how were they? how did you like them?
- what techniques do you use to conduct your research?
- what drew you to connecting neurological behaviors to the animals corresponding ecological niche?
	- hey :D thats kinda what i do :D

Meeting Notes

- give sama a summary of laurence vibes by nov 7

modelled sleep from behavioral data - rebound sleep / no rebound sleep in different species in different contexts

more interested in moving away from sleep to hidden states / internal states
targeted behavioral neuroscience 
different processing with different brain states
how locomotion affects processing

*very in line with other projects in the lab - how different states affect sensory processing*

values connection and collaboration inside the lab and personal relationship with lab members outside of the lab

doesnt like micromanagement, looks forward to working in this kind of lab environment
