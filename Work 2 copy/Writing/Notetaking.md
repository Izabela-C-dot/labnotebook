## Modular Notes 
Modular notes are short notes written in clear language that are meant to express a *single* idea. They serve as the building blocks for larger ideas. 

Effective modular notes follow three criteria
1. The title of the note is a complete sentence
2. The body of the note is a short, detailed and contextualized expansion of the single idea expressed in the title
3. The note contains a reference

Modular notes make you  practice writing in a simple and structured way, which helps build endurance and develop a sustainable writing practice.

Modular notes are meant to be connected, and there are many benefits that come from linking  notes. Connecting new ideas leads to revisiting previous material, which helps strengthen the memory of that material. Prioritizing links between ideas makes you consider new and interesting connections, which can help move research forward in unexpected ways

## Daily Lab Notes

Daily notes are the foundation of a lab notebook. 
Heading ; YYYY-MM-DD-ddd (2024-05-01-Wed)

"They include ideas, tasks, thoughts, protocols, plots, links, and really any relevant effort expended that day.

Backlink extensively and use "hub notes" to organize effort that is split across days, weeks, contexts, etc" (3)

## Hub Notes
Hub notes serve as a central node for backlinking to various modular notes
I think the format of a timeline or an outline would be the most effective structure for me

Hub notes provide a central reference point for backlink connections

#### A guide for structuring a hub note for a particular project 
(*edit as i go, tailor this to myself*)

- Project introduction (linked modular note)
- To do list (linked mod notes in a list)
- Completed items (linked mod notes)
- Links to external files (google etc) 
- Relevant Literature
- Timeline of daily notes - with short summaries next to each for what i did on that day for this specific project

## how to nurture a writing practice
1. Trust the process
	1. Sit down and get *something* done everyday, no matter how done (doing something small is *still* doing something) - trust the process, habits need time and momentum to build
2. Find the right time and place
	1. Place and time to be consistent, set yourself up for success
3. Start small and build the habit
	1. Start small and build from there, but don't push too hard too fast and get discouraged - start small and build
4. Find an accountability partner
	1. Co-working! It can be kind of a social thing , and having it be fun and enjoyable makes it easier to keep doing
	2. *this one may not be for you all of the time, but its good sometime, maybe use when you feel more stuck?*
5. Have more than one project going at a time
	1. If one project hurts or makes you feel stuck, you can bounce to something else (and doing something fun - having hobbies - helps you get past the negative emotions that can develop if you're stuck on a specific thing with work - help define you past the project)

Imposter syndrome, perfectionism, self doubt **hurt** you
Develop self compassion and self confidence
You CAN do this <3 you haven't done this before, it makes sense that you need time to learn and improve
