sama has a list of 'no-no' words on the agora, words and phrases that are overused or don't contribute to the strength of a piece. I really like this idea, and I think making my own list could help improve my writing.

- allows / enables / provides
	- weak verb, can be replaced with a stronger word
- utilize
	- just use 'use'
- novel
	- just say new, or interesting, or a stronger more specific descriptor
Simple can be brave and beautiful. Scientific jargon can get in the way of your meaning. Prioritize clarity and honesty.
